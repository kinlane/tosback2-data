<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN class=font_fieldHeader EditorStyled="True">Cookies</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=font_header EditorStyled="True"></SPAN>We may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.&nbsp; Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.&nbsp; Cookies track where you travel on our Web site and what you look at and purchase.&nbsp; They may store, for example, the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and/or password.&nbsp; All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Website.&nbsp; <BR>Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.&nbsp; Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies (technically known as Flash “local shared objects”).&nbsp; However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web site or certain areas or features of the Web site.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN class=font_fieldHeader EditorStyled="True">Clear GIFs</SPAN></P>
<P>We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the Website and/or in our communications with you, for example, to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message.&nbsp; A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><SPAN class=font_fieldHeader EditorStyled="True">IP Address and Clickstream Data</SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Our server automatically collects data about your server's Internet address when you visit us.&nbsp; This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider (i.e., if you are using your Road Runner account, us) whenever you're on the Internet.&nbsp; When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.&nbsp; Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the site you visit after this Website; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers.&nbsp; We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website.&nbsp; Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
