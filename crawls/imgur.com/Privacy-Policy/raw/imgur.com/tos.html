        your consent to these terms of use and to our <a href="http://imgur.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not consent, do not use
        our website.
        <br/><br/>
        Your use of our website to do anything beyond simply accessing/viewing it (that is, uploading,
        downloading, commenting, etc.), constitutes not merely your consent, but also your electronic
        signature, meaning that you are contractually bound by these terms and by our Privacy Policy.

			<h2>Stuff not to do</h2>
			<p>
        If someone else might own the copyright to it, don’t upload it. Don’t upload gore, obscenity,
        advertising, solicitations, "hate speech" (i.e. demeaning race, gender, age, religious or sexual 
        orientation, etc.), or material that is threatening, harassing, defamatory, or that encourages 
        illegality. Don’t hotlink to such content, or to file-sharing or torrent sites. Don’t be a troll 
        or a jerk. Don't impersonate someone else. If you do (and we will be the judge), or if you do 
        anything illegal, in addition to any other legal rights we may have, we will ban you along with 
        the site you're hotlinking from, delete all your images, report you to the authorities if necessary, 
        and prevent you from viewing any images hosted on Imgur.com. We mean it.

			<h2>Stuff to do, please</h2>
			<p>
        If you see anything on our site that shouldn’t be there because it violates our policies or for any

        Avoid foul language for anything you make publicly available. Use asterisks *** to self-bleep if

			<h2>About images you upload</h2>
			<p>
        You can upload images anonymously and share them online with only the people you choose to
        share them with. If you make them publicly available, they may be featured in the gallery. This
        means that if you upload an image to share with your friend, only your friend will be able to
        access it online. However, if you share an image with Facebook, Twitter, Digg, Reddit, etc, then
        it may end up in the gallery.

      <p>
        By uploading a file or other content or by making a comment, you represent and warrant to us
        that (1) doing so does not violate or infringe anyone else’s rights; and (2) you created the file
        or other content you are uploading, or otherwise have sufficient intellectual property rights
        to upload the material consistent with these terms. With regard to any file or content you upload 
        to the public portions of our site, you grant Imgur a non-exclusive, royalty- free, perpetual, 
        irrevocable worldwide license (with sublicense and assignment rights) to use, to display online 
        and in any present or future media, to create derivative works of, to allow downloads of, and/or 
        distribute any such file or content.  To the extent that you delete a such file or content from 
        the public portions of our site, the license you grant to Imgur pursuant to the preceding sentence 
        will automatically terminate, but will not be revoked with respect to any file or content Imgur 
        has already copied and sublicensed or designated for sublicense.  Also, of course, anything you 
        post to a public portion of our site may be used by the public pursuant to the following paragraph

        NOTICES OF CLAIMED COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
        <br/><br/>
        If you see anything on our site that you believe infringes your copyright rights, you may notify
        our Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") agent by sending the following 
        information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identification of the copyrighted work or works claimed to have been infringed;</li>
        <li>Identification of the material on our servers that is claimed to be infringing and that is to be
        removed, including the URL or other information to enable us to locate the material;</li>
        <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner
        complained of is not authorized by you as copyright owner, or by your agent, or by law;</li>
        <li>A statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that
        you are the owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the exclusive copyright
        right that is allegedly being infringed.</li>
        <li>Your physical or electronic signature, or of someone authorized to act on your behalf;</li>
        <li>Instructions on how we may contact you: preferably email, but also address and phone</li>
      </ul>

      Our agent to receive such notifications of claimed infringement is Alan Schaaf.

      <p>
        Use the same procedure for any claimed trademark violations or other infringements. If we receive a 
        DMCA notice and remove something you posted anonymously, we will have no way of notifying you, so 
        you will have to contact us if you think that may have happened.  Keep in mind that we reserve the 
        right to remove any content at any time whether or not it infringes or violates any of our policies.

			<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
			<p>
        "Imgur" or "we" refers to Imgur LLC, a California limited liability company, and its successors
        and assigns. "You" refers to any person who has consented to these terms or has become
        contractually bound to them, whether such person is identified or not at the time. These terms
        are governed by California law, excluding its conflicts of law principles, and if there is a lawsuit
        between you and Imgur, jurisdiction and venue will lie exclusively in the State where the
        defendant is located, if within the United States, or in Santa Clara County, California otherwise.
        If any part of these terms is invalid, the remaining provisions will be unaffected. These Terms
        of Use constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to this subject matter, and
        they will continue to govern any issues that arise out of your use of Imgur's services even after
        you discontinue using them. We may revise these terms from time to time without notice.
        Whenever we do so, we will so indicate by changing the version date at the top. Any changes

        apply as of the time they are posted. Imgur is not meant for use by children under age 13; if
        your child is younger than 13 please allow him or her to use it only under your supervision.
