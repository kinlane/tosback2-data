        If you are matched with Requested Service  Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested Service Providers conducting  any research necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request.&nbsp; Requested Service Providers may need to share  your personally identifiable information to conduct such research.&nbsp; As an example, if you request insurance  quotes, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance  application.&nbsp; Such reports may provide  information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the  price you may be charged for insurance.&nbsp; Consumer reports may also be  used for updates, renewal or extensions of this insurance.&nbsp; In addition, insurance companies may use  third parties in connection with the development of a &ldquo;insurance score&rdquo; for  you.&nbsp; <strong>If you do not want  Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a  quote for your Request, then you should not submit a Request</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
