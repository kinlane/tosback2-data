<h2><span>Trusted Users</span></h2>
<p>wikiHow may provide certain Users with administrative privileges in order to monitor or provide certain aspects of the Service (“Trusted Users”).

For the avoidance of doubt, wikiHow Trusted Users include, but are not limited to, “Admins” (aka SysOps or Administrators) and “New Article Boosters.” You acknowledge that wikiHow may revoke your status as a Trusted User at any time for any reason or no reason, and may require you to enter into further agreements with wikiHow depending on your role.</p>
<p>If you are a Trusted User, you acknowledge that you may have access to the personal information of other Users, and you represent and warrant that you will handle that information in accordance with the wikiHow <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Privacy-Policy" title="wikiHow:Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> and the confidentiality obligations contained herein. You further acknowledge that you may have access to wikiHow Confidential Information (as defined below), and you represent and warrant, at all times you are serving as a Trusted User and thereafter, to hold in strictest confidence, and not to use, except for the benefit of wikiHow to the extent necessary to perform authorized services on behalf of wikiHow, and not to disclose to any person, firm, corporation or other entity, without written authorization from wikiHow in each instance, any wikiHow Confidential Information that you obtain from wikiHow or otherwise obtain, access or create in connection with, or as a result of, your relationship with wikiHow or your performance of any services as a Trusted User, until such wikiHow Confidential Information becomes publicly and widely known and made generally available through no wrongful act of you or of others who were under confidentiality obligations as to the item or items involved.

<h2><span>User Content</span></h2>

The User Content you create remains yours; however, by sharing User Content through the Service, you agree to allow others to view, edit, and/or share your User Content in accordance with this Agreement (see “User Content License Grants” below). wikiHow has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Service.</p>

You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy. wikiHow reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that wikiHow believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions or is otherwise inappropriate for the Service.

<p>THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF WIKIHOW HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.</p>
<p>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
<p>The Service is controlled and operated from facilities in the United States. wikiHow makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.</p>

<h2><span>Governing Law and Arbitration.</span></h2>
<p>A. Governing Law.</p>
<p>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over wikiHow, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.</p>
<p>B. Arbitration.</p>
<p>For any dispute with wikiHow, you agree to first contact us at wiki@wikiHow.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that wikiHow has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any wikiHow claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and wikiHow agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WIKIHOW ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
<p><a name="General" id="General"></a></p>
<h2><span>General</span></h2>
<p>A. Assignment.</p>
<p>This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by wikiHow without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
<p>B. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.</p>
<p>wikiHow may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by wikiHow in our sole discretion. wikiHow reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. wikiHow is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. WikiHow may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date on this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.</p>
<p>C. Entire Agreement/Severability.</p>
<p>This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with wikiHow in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and wikiHow concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>D. No Waiver.</p>
<p>No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and wikiHow’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p>E. Contact. Please contact us wiki@wikiHow.com with any questions regarding this Agreement.</p>
