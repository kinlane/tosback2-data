          <p class="bodytext">
            When you send sensitive information (such as your credit card number) to us via our order form, that information is encrypted and
            protected with SSL, the current industry-standard encryption protocol. When you are on such an SSL-protected page, a picture of a
            closed lock appears at the bottom or top of some Web browsers. At other times this lock appears open. Another way to tell if you
            are on a secure page is to look at the address or URL of the page. (Look in the address box or right-click on the page and select

            <strong> Wayfair Rewards Program</strong><br/>This program is exclusively for users of the
            Wayfair websites who have registered for the program in accordance with the directions
            set forth below.  When you make a qualifying purchase at any of the websites designated as participating sites  by
            Wayfair from time to time (the "Participating Sites"), you will have the opportunity
            to earn Wayfair "Rewards Dollars" equal to three percent (3%) of the net amount
            paid for that qualifying purchase, which Rewards Dollars may only be applied to future purchases at the Participating Sites in
            accordance with these Terms of Use.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="underline">Enrollment and Eligibility.</span> To enroll in the Wayfair            rewards program (the "Rewards Program"), you must register at the Rewards Program landing page which can be accessed by clicking
            the following link: https://www.wayfair.com/asp/secure/session/account/rewards_info.asp .  There are no fees or charges
            to enroll in the Rewards Program.  Only individuals are eligible to enroll, each Member may have only one account and use only one
            email address. Accounts may not be combined.  Membership is limited to legal residents of the fifty (50) United States and the
            District of Columbia and Canada (excluding Quebec) who are 18 years of age or older, or the age of majority in their state,
            province or territory of residence, whichever is older, at the time they register for the Rewards Program.  Corporations,
            groups, or other associated entities are not eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.  Employees of
            Wayfair and SK Retail, Inc. are not eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.
            Persons who are eligible for and have properly registered for the Rewards Program shall be referred to hereinafter as "Member(s)."
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="underline">Collect Rewards Dollars.</span> A Member can collect Rewards Dollars when he or she purchases and pays in full
            for products ordered online at one of the Participating Sites (the "Transaction").  Rewards Dollars will be issued in an amount equal
            to three percent (3%) of the net amount paid for the Transaction, regardless of method of payment.  If the net amount paid for the
            original Transaction changes for any reason, whether due to a subsequent change in products purchased or otherwise, any associated
            Reward Dollars will be adjusted to reflect the modified net amount paid for the Transaction.  Rewards Dollars will be credited to a
            Member's account within ten (10) days of the closing of each qualifying Transaction.  All dollar amounts are rounded down.  Rewards
            Dollars are earned on the net US dollar amount paid on the Transaction, and will be in the form of a credit in US currency that can
            be applied to another future Transaction.  The "net amount" shall mean the cash amount paid by the Member for the product(s)
            purchased in connection with the Transaction, excluding any payment of applicable taxes, and shipping and handling charges and after
            applying any discounts or other credits.   Rewards Dollars are not earned on any discounted dollar amounts, applicable taxes,
            shipping and handling charges, returns, credits, purchases of gift cards and/or gift certificates, or purchases in whole or in part
            with Rewards Dollars.  No Rewards Dollars will be earned for any activities prior to enrollment.  Rewards Dollars are not valid for
            cash or cash equivalents.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="underline">Redemption of Rewards Dollars.</span> Rewards Dollars can be only redeemed and applied as a credit against the
            purchase price of a Transaction.  In order to redeem Rewards Dollars, you must either enter the promotional code assigned to you for
            such redemption when you confirm the Transaction or, if available, check the applicable box during the checkout process on any
            Participating Sites.  Rewards Dollars are not redeemable for cash or cash equivalent and may not be applied toward payment of any
            outstanding Wayfair account balances or previous purchases.  Rewards Dollars may not
            be combined with other Wayfair promotions, offers, or other discounts.  Except in the
            case of valid returns as specified below, no credits or refunds will be issued for any reason after Rewards Dollars have been redeemed,
            including for unused Rewards Dollars.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="underline">Returns.</span> If you return an item that was purchased in whole or in part using Rewards Dollars, such return
            will be processed in accordance with Wayfair's return and exchange policy and if the
            return is accepted by Wayfair, the Rewards Dollars applicable to the returned item will
            be credited back to your account.

            <span class="underline">Non-Transferability and Non-Aggregation of Rewards Dollars.</span> Rewards Dollars and any other right,
            obligation or benefit of the Rewards Program may not be transferred, assigned, sold, traded or bartered by any Member or any other
            person, without Wayfair's prior written consent, which
            Wayfair may withhold in its sole discretion, and any attempt to do any of the foregoing
            shall be null and void. In addition, Rewards Dollars are for the Member's personal use only.  Members may not aggregate Rewards
            Dollars from multiple accounts or use Rewards Dollars for the purpose of purchasing products from the Participating Sites on behalf
            of others or for the purpose of reselling such products to others.

            <span class="underline">Inactivity/Cancellation</span> In the event a Member does not make a Transaction using or generating Rewards
            Dollars for a full calendar year, Wayfair reserves the right to cancel the Member's
            participation in the Rewards Program and zero out any and all Rewards Dollars earned. In addition, you may cancel your participation
            in the Rewards Program by calling the following toll-free number 1-877-WAYFAIR and/or sending an email to service@wayfair.com, in

          <p class="bodytext">
            The following terms and conditions (the "Terms") apply to any Wayfair electronic gift certificate 
            originally purchased by you or someone on your behalf (the "gift certificate") through the Wayfair 
            website.  Gift certificates are issued by Wayfair LLC (referred to hereinafter 
            as either "Wayfair", "we", "us" or "our").  By purchasing a gift certificate, accepting and retaining a gift certificate,
           or using a gift certificate, you agree to these Terms.
          </p>

          <ul class="bodytext">
            <li>Gift certificates are only valid in the United States of America and Canada. Void where prohibited.</li>
            <li>Gift certificates can only be redeemed through one of the Wayfair websites. </li>
            <li>Gift certificates cannot be used to purchase gift certificates or gift cards.</li>
            <li>Gift certificates are not redeemable for cash and cannot be returned for a cash refund, except to the extent required by law.</li>
            <li>Use of the gift certificate is limited to the amount of funds held on the gift certificate.  The full amount of each purchase,
              including taxes, will be deducted from the funds held on the gift certificate, up to the total funds available on the gift
              certificate. Any unused balance will be placed in the recipient's gift certificate account and is not transferable. If you
              make a purchase and there are insufficient funds held on the gift certificate to cover that purchase, you must pay the difference
              by a valid credit card or debit card.</li>
            <li>The risk of loss and title for gift certificates pass to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission to the purchaser.
              We are not responsible for and will not replace lost or stolen gift certificates. Protect your gift certificate as if it were
              cash and safeguard the gift certificate from authorized use.</li>
            <li>Wayfair may provide gift certificate purchasers with information about the redemption status of gift certificates.</li>
            <li>Wayfair reserves the right to change these Terms from time to time in its discretion. Such revised terms will be effective
              as to any gift certificates purchased after the date said revised Terms are posted to the Wayfair websites.</li>
            <li>Resale of a gift certificate or use for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or other promotional purposes is
              strictly prohibited.  Your right to use the funds on the gift certificate is a limited right, subject to these Terms and
              applicable law.  We are not responsible for pricing, typographical, or other errors, in any offer and reserve the right to
               cancel any orders resulting from such errors.  </li>
            <li>If we suspect any fraud or misuse in connection with a gift certificate, we reserve the right in our discretion to suspend
              or terminate use of the gift certificate.</li>
            <li>The consideration paid for the gift certificate, including any unredeemed balances, is the property of the Wayfair.  </li>
            <li>We do not currently collect or maintain any personally identifiable information regarding the purchasers of the Cards.
              However, we reserve the right to obtain personal information about you in accordance with the privacy policy found

            The Internet has created a tremendous opportunity for manufacturers to drive additional revenue growth and reach a new and growing set
            of customers. For seven years, we have enabled our suppliers to successfully tap into this growth while working closely with them to
            protect and promote their brand, complement their existing retail channels and facilitate smooth logistics and communications flow.
            We understand the importance of flexibility and tailor our approach to meet our suppliers' specific needs.

            desire to have a consistent value proposition and brand message across all of their retail outlets and we work
            closely to ensure our relationship is complementary to our suppliers' existing sales channels.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <strong>Flexibility and Ease</strong> - Each of our suppliers works closely with a Wayfair category team that is highly
            proficient at taking the supplier though the entire process of: (1) establishing the relationship, (2) effectively merchandising the product,
            (3) driving growth and (4) providing excellent customer service. We understand that every supplier may have unique needs in areas of
            logistics, order flow, payments, returns, etc. and we try to tune our approach to match our suppliers' needs and to make the entire
            process as smooth and seamless as possible.
