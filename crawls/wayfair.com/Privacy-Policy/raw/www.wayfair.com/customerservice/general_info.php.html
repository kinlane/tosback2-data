          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            When you send sensitive information (such as your credit card number) to us via our order form, that information is encrypted and
            protected with SSL, the current industry-standard encryption protocol. When you are on such an SSL-protected page, a picture of a
            closed lock appears at the bottom or top of some Web browsers. At other times this lock appears open. Another way to tell if you
            are on a secure page is to look at the address or URL of the page. (Look in the address box or right-click on the page and select
            "Properties".) These secure SSL-encrypted pages have URLs that start with https:// instead of http://.

          <p class="bodytext">
            The following terms and conditions (the "Terms") apply to any Wayfair electronic gift certificate 
            originally purchased by you or someone on your behalf (the "gift certificate") through the Wayfair 
            website.  Gift certificates are issued by Wayfair LLC (referred to hereinafter 
            as either "Wayfair", "we", "us" or "our").  By purchasing a gift certificate, accepting and retaining a gift certificate,
           or using a gift certificate, you agree to these Terms.
          </p>

          <ul class="bodytext">
            <li>Gift certificates are only valid in the United States of America and Canada. Void where prohibited.</li>
            <li>Gift certificates can only be redeemed through one of the Wayfair websites. </li>
            <li>Gift certificates cannot be used to purchase gift certificates or gift cards.</li>
            <li>Gift certificates are not redeemable for cash and cannot be returned for a cash refund, except to the extent required by law.</li>
            <li>Use of the gift certificate is limited to the amount of funds held on the gift certificate.  The full amount of each purchase,
              including taxes, will be deducted from the funds held on the gift certificate, up to the total funds available on the gift
              certificate. Any unused balance will be placed in the recipient's gift certificate account and is not transferable. If you
              make a purchase and there are insufficient funds held on the gift certificate to cover that purchase, you must pay the difference
              by a valid credit card or debit card.</li>
            <li>The risk of loss and title for gift certificates pass to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission to the purchaser.
              We are not responsible for and will not replace lost or stolen gift certificates. Protect your gift certificate as if it were
              cash and safeguard the gift certificate from authorized use.</li>
            <li>Wayfair may provide gift certificate purchasers with information about the redemption status of gift certificates.</li>
            <li>Wayfair reserves the right to change these Terms from time to time in its discretion. Such revised terms will be effective
              as to any gift certificates purchased after the date said revised Terms are posted to the Wayfair websites.</li>
            <li>Resale of a gift certificate or use for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or other promotional purposes is
              strictly prohibited.  Your right to use the funds on the gift certificate is a limited right, subject to these Terms and
              applicable law.  We are not responsible for pricing, typographical, or other errors, in any offer and reserve the right to
               cancel any orders resulting from such errors.  </li>
            <li>If we suspect any fraud or misuse in connection with a gift certificate, we reserve the right in our discretion to suspend
              or terminate use of the gift certificate.</li>
            <li>The consideration paid for the gift certificate, including any unredeemed balances, is the property of the Wayfair.  </li>
            <li>We do not currently collect or maintain any personally identifiable information regarding the purchasers of the Cards.
              However, we reserve the right to obtain personal information about you in accordance with the privacy policy found
              <a title="Privacy Policy" href="general_info.php.html#privacy">here</a>

              invalid, then such covenants, agreements, provisions or terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, agreements,
              provisions or terms of these Terms shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of these Terms.</li>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <strong>Interested In Being a Supplier?</strong><br />
            The Internet has created a tremendous opportunity for manufacturers to drive additional revenue growth and reach a new and growing set
            of customers. For seven years, we have enabled our suppliers to successfully tap into this growth while working closely with them to
            protect and promote their brand, complement their existing retail channels and facilitate smooth logistics and communications flow.
            We understand the importance of flexibility and tailor our approach to meet our suppliers' specific needs.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            We value our 2,000+ supplier relationships and believe these to be the key elements to fostering a successful partnership:
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <strong>Commitment to Growth</strong> - Our goal is to rapidly grow revenues and become the top online channel partner for each of our
            suppliers. Our category teams' significant product expertise combined with our ongoing investment in online, email and traditional
            marketing, ensures maximum impact as we launch new suppliers' products.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <strong>Partnership in Customer Service Excellence</strong> - Wayfair's ability to provide great customer service begins with our
            supplier's commitment to ship orders quickly, package products with care, provide accurate in-stock status and work with us to rapidly
            handle any issues that may arise.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <strong>Brand and Channel Integrity</strong> - Wayfair is absolutely committed to helping its suppliers' brand flourish online.
            We collaborate with our suppliers to tell their products' stories the way they want them told. We are sensitive to our suppliers'
            desire to have a consistent value proposition and brand message across all of their retail outlets and we work
            closely to ensure our relationship is complementary to our suppliers' existing sales channels.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <strong>Flexibility and Ease</strong> - Each of our suppliers works closely with a Wayfair category team that is highly
            proficient at taking the supplier though the entire process of: (1) establishing the relationship, (2) effectively merchandising the product,
            (3) driving growth and (4) providing excellent customer service. We understand that every supplier may have unique needs in areas of
            logistics, order flow, payments, returns, etc. and we try to tune our approach to match our suppliers' needs and to make the entire
            process as smooth and seamless as possible.
