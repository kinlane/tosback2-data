            Any dispute between you and Wayfair, its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries
            or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, '<strong>Wayfair</strong>') arising from or relating to these Terms
            of Use and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms of Use, including
            disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "<strong>Covered Disputes</strong>") will be settled by binding
            arbitration in Suffolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration
            Rules, in effect on the date thereof. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advanced
            written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Wayfair will provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with 
            Wayfair and you must provide such notice by e-mail to [disputeresolution@wayfair.com].

          <p class="bodytext">
            During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable
            settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief
            would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be
            entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages,
            the right to which each party hereby waives, and the arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms of Use and the failure to
            do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. Wayfair and you agree that any Covered Dispute
            hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Wayfair nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered
            Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or
            private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision
            will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general
            arbitration). Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these Terms of Use must be made within one
            (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred. For purposes of this section, these Terms of Use and related transactions will be subject to and
            governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).

          <p class="bodytext">
            <strong>Interested In Being a Supplier?</strong><br />
            The Internet has created a tremendous opportunity for manufacturers to drive additional revenue growth and reach a new and growing set
            of customers. For seven years, we have enabled our suppliers to successfully tap into this growth while working closely with them to
            protect and promote their brand, complement their existing retail channels and facilitate smooth logistics and communications flow.
            We understand the importance of flexibility and tailor our approach to meet our suppliers' specific needs.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            We value our 2,000+ supplier relationships and believe these to be the key elements to fostering a successful partnership:
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <strong>Commitment to Growth</strong> - Our goal is to rapidly grow revenues and become the top online channel partner for each of our
            suppliers. Our category teams' significant product expertise combined with our ongoing investment in online, email and traditional
            marketing, ensures maximum impact as we launch new suppliers' products.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <strong>Partnership in Customer Service Excellence</strong> - Wayfair's ability to provide great customer service begins with our
            supplier's commitment to ship orders quickly, package products with care, provide accurate in-stock status and work with us to rapidly
            handle any issues that may arise.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <strong>Brand and Channel Integrity</strong> - Wayfair is absolutely committed to helping its suppliers' brand flourish online.
            We collaborate with our suppliers to tell their products' stories the way they want them told. We are sensitive to our suppliers'
            desire to have a consistent value proposition and brand message across all of their retail outlets and we work
            closely to ensure our relationship is complementary to our suppliers' existing sales channels.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">
            <strong>Flexibility and Ease</strong> - Each of our suppliers works closely with a Wayfair category team that is highly
            proficient at taking the supplier though the entire process of: (1) establishing the relationship, (2) effectively merchandising the product,
            (3) driving growth and (4) providing excellent customer service. We understand that every supplier may have unique needs in areas of
            logistics, order flow, payments, returns, etc. and we try to tune our approach to match our suppliers' needs and to make the entire
            process as smooth and seamless as possible.
          </p>
