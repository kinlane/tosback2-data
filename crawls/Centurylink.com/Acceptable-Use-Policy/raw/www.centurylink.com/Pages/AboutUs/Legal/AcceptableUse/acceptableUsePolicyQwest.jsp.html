			<h1>Qwest's Acceptable Use Policy</h1>
 
<p>
Qwest has formulated this Acceptable Use Policy (&quot;AUP&quot;) in order to
encourage the responsible use of Qwest's networks, systems, services,
web sites and products (collectively, the "Qwest Network and Services")
by our customers and other users of the Qwest Network and Services
(collectively, "Users"), and to enable us to provide Users with secure,
reliable and productive services. By using the Qwest Network and
Services, Users consent to be bound by the terms of this AUP. Qwest
reserves the right to modify this AUP in its discretion at any time.
Such modifications will be effective when posted. Any use of the Qwest
Network and Services after such modification shall constitute acceptance
of such modification.</p>
 
<p>
<b>Suspension; Termination.</b> Any User which Qwest determines to have
violated any element of this AUP may be subject to a suspension or
termination of service.  Qwest will suspend service for violation of the
AUP on the most limited basis as Qwest determines is reasonably
practical under the circumstances to address the underlying violation.
Qwest will attempt to notify Customer prior to suspending service for
violation of the AUP (which may be via email or any other notification);
provided, however, Qwest may suspend service without notice if Qwest
becomes aware of a violation of any applicable law or regulation or
activity, including but not limited to a violation of the AUP, that
exposes Qwest to criminal or civil liability or that exposes the Qwest
network or Qwest customers' network or property to harm. Such harm to a
network may include, but is not limited to, risk of having an IP address
placed on blacklists. Qwest may take such further action as Qwest
determines to be appropriate under the circumstances to eliminate or
preclude repeat violations, and Qwest shall not be liable for any
damages of any nature suffered by any Customer, User, or any third party
resulting in whole or in part from Qwest's exercise of its rights under
this AUP.</p>
