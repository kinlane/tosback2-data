<p>

<p>
You agree that you shall not post or provide any information to/for the Sites:
<p>
<ul><li>that is known by you to be false, inaccurate or misleading; </li>  
<li>that infringes any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; </li>
<li>that violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation in any applicable jurisdictions (including, but not limited to, those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, false advertising and privacy); </li>
<li>that is, or may reasonably be considered to be, defamatory, hateful, racially or religiously biased or offensive (including the use of swear words), unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing to any individual, partnership or corporation; </li>
<li>for which you were compensated or granted any consideration by any third party; </li>
<li>that seeks to obtain a commercial advantage; </li>
<li>that includes any information that references other web sites, addresses, email addresses, contact information, phone numbers or other personal information such as credit card numbers; or </li>
<li>that contains any computer viruses, worms or other damaging or potentially damaging computer programs or files. </li>
</ul>
<p>In contributing or submitting any content to the Site, you agree not to use a false or misleading email address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise provide any misleading information as to the origin of any content that you submit. You should also note your obligations to indemnify PriceGrabber (among others) for the content you submit as set forth in the indemnity section, below. 
<p>You agree that you will not use any device, software or routine to bypass our robot exclusion headers, or to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site or any sales being conducted through the Site. You agree that you will not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on PriceGrabber's computer systems or communications infrastructure. You agree that you will not use any software robot, spider, other automatic device or manual process to monitor or copy Site pages or the content contained therein without PriceGrabber's prior written consent. 
<p>
<strong>MERCHANT REVIEWS</strong>
<p>You may submit a merchant review through the Merchant Ratings System on the Site or through the Shopper Satisfaction Survey to describe your shopping experiences with merchants. 
<ul>
<li>You may submit a merchant review only in good faith and about a merchant from whom you have actually purchased or attempted to purchase products, limited to where you have (i) completed the ordering process, (ii) exchanged payment data, and/or (iii) received an invoice number. </li>
<li>You agree to submit the corresponding and legitimate invoice number or equivalent confirmation of order number/identifier when submitting the merchant review ("Invoice Number"). You acknowledge and agree that the Invoice Number will be made available by PriceGrabber to the applicable merchant in conjunction with your review, and accordingly, the merchant may be able to contact you regarding your review or otherwise. </li>
<li>You may only describe your experience with the merchant for which you are writing a merchant review. You should not review any merchant on situations that are not controlled by the merchant you are reviewing. </li>
<li>You may submit no more than one merchant review of a particular merchant in any thirty (30) day period. </li>
<li>Any merchant review that you submit is subject to the conditions and restrictions described in the CONTENT SUBMISSION section, above. </li>
<li>You acknowledge and agree that PriceGrabber may, in its sole discretion, post only the first ten (10) merchant reviews it receives from users (which may not include your review) that are related, on a case by case basis and in whole or in part, to a product or service listing error by a merchant, such as, but not limited to, an error in the price of a product(s) or a service, the number of units of a product(s) available for a certain price, the shipping rates for product(s), or inventory levels. </li>
</ul>
<p>Upon becoming aware of the same, PriceGrabber will omit any merchant review that it determines on the face of the review (only) violates any requirements in this Terms of Use or the Member Agreement. PriceGrabber will not itself edit or modify the contents of a merchant review; it will only remove a review in accordance with the foregoing. 
<p>By providing the Invoice Number, you acknowledge and agree that you may be contacted by PriceGrabber and/or the applicable merchant to which/whom the invoice relates. You acknowledge and agree that your review may not be displayed if the Invoice Number does not match the associated information in PriceGrabber's records. A merchant may dispute the validity of an invoice identified by you and may submit a complaint to PriceGrabber. This may result in PriceGrabber opening a user review inquiry. During the user review inquiry, PriceGrabber may, in its sole discretion, remove the contested review, and/or require additional data or proof from the user to determine whether the review should remain or be reinstated on the Site. Failure of the user to participate in the user review inquiry will result in the removal of the contested review from the Site. 
<p>In order to submit a merchant review you may be required to have a Confirmed Member Account or higher (as described in the Member Account Levels Policy available at <a href="http://www.pricegrabber.com/info_policies.php/policy=accounts">http://www.pricegrabber.com/info_policies.php/policy=accounts</a>).

<p>
<strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong>
<p>
These Terms of Use and Privacy Statement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflicts or choice of law. In addition, the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, including any amendments thereto, is expressly excluded hereby. Except for disputes arising from an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or breach of confidentiality, for which the injured party may suffer irreparable harm and may seek a restraining order, preliminary injunctive relief, an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief and/or legal remedies, and actions to enforce the decisions of the arbitrators, for which action may be taken in any court of competent jurisdiction, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, including the scope, the construction or application of this Agreement, shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association then in force. The arbitration hearings and all meetings pursuant to this section shall be held in Los Angeles, California, USA, and shall be conducted in English. If the parties cannot agree upon a single arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after demand by either of them, each party shall select one arbitrator knowledgeable about Internet commerce in California and the USA generally, and notify the other of its selection, and such two arbitrators shall select a third from a list of arbitrators (with knowledge of the Internet industry) qualified by the American Arbitration Association in California. If this procedure for selecting arbitrators fails, then a neutral arbitrator based in California with knowledge of Internet commerce in California and the USA generally shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association to resolve the dispute. The arbitrator(s) shall conduct a hearing within thirty (30) days after their selection. A majority of the arbitrators (if there is more than one pursuant to this clause) shall determine the decision/award, which shall be rendered within five (5) days after the completion of the hearing. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the parties both as to law and to fact, and shall not be appealable to any court in any jurisdiction. The parties shall share the expenses of the arbitrators equally. Nothing in any indemnification provision hereunder shall be construed as having any bearing on the award of attorneys' fees or arbitrators' fees under this section.

<strong><a name='pr_pol_sec'></a>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
<p>
At PriceGrabber.com Inc. ("PriceGrabber") we want you to know exactly how and when we collect and use information that can specifically identify you, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address ("personal information"). 
<p>
We do not require that you provide, nor do we collect, any personal information if you are just browsing the Site. We may offer on the Site non-transactional and transaction based services ("Service(s)") in which, subject to applicable terms and availability, you may participate (e.g., submitting product reviews or becoming a Member to buy or sell items through the Storefronts Service). In order to provide you with the Services you request, PriceGrabber may require that you first provide certain personal information, which we determine is reasonably necessary in order for us to fulfill your request. If you indicate an interest in participating in a Service, we will identify what specific personal information you must provide prior to collecting such information. Any personal information which we collect from you will only be used for the purposes identified in this Privacy Statement, the PriceGrabber Terms of Use and your applicable Member Agreement with PriceGrabber, and as may otherwise be indicated at the time the information is collected. To update, modify or delete any personal information you provide to us with respect to a Service you may access your account with PriceGrabber, make the changes on <A HREF="http://www.pricegrabber.com/account.php/settings/">http://www.pricegrabber.com/account.php/settings/</A> and submit the same to PriceGrabber. 
<p>
PriceGrabber will not disclose your personal information to any third party unless: 1) it is necessary in order to provide you with a particular Service you have requested; 2) it is required of PriceGrabber in order to comply with a legal process in any applicable jurisdiction (e.g., court order, subpoena, search warrant, law enforcement request); 3) PriceGrabber determines, in its sole discretion, that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of PriceGrabber, its subsidiaries, affiliates, co-brand partners or other parties under contract with PriceGrabber, our users, or others; or 4) you have provided such data through a partner's private-level shopping web site hosted by PriceGrabber, in which case PriceGrabber may provide your personal data to that partner (PriceGrabber is not responsible for its partners' privacy policies or their use, storage and processing of data collected on their web sites). In addition, PriceGrabber may transmit information to a merchant, such as an invoice number, which may permit the merchant to deduce the identity of a user/reviewer in the event that a merchant disputes a user review on the grounds that a transaction never took place between the user and the merchant and/or an order was never made by the user in each case for the applicable product(s)/service(s). 
<p>
In certain instances, PriceGrabber may request that you provide secondary information (e.g., demographic information), which we may use, for example, to learn more about our customers and to develop and improve our services. Any requests for secondary information will be marked "optional" (or its equivalent). We may compile your personal information with that collected from other customers to create aggregate data. Aggregate data is information about groups of customers and, once compiled, will in no way identify you as an individual. We may disclose aggregate data to our business affiliates, advertisers, and other parties. 
<p>
<a name='pr_poloo_sec'></a>Our web servers collect from Site visitors’ statistical information regarding what pages are visited, the date and time of the visits, how long it took a user to download a page, and the TCP/IP address of the user. These automated server functions do not collect this information in a manner intended to identify your individual use of the Site, nor do we use this information for any such purpose. This information is collected to assist us in maintaining a high quality site, as well as, providing necessary traffic information to our advertisers. We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes the product codes and prices for merchandise that visitors purchase, and the pages visited. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this website analysis tool by clicking here:  <A HREF="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy#optout">http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy#optout</A>

For example, we utilize a cookie in the BottomLinePrice&#0153; feature of the Site to store the zip code that you are using to provide customized shipping and sales tax information. In conjunction with our in-house advertising, we use third-party advertising companies to place customized advertisements on the pages you view on the Site. Our third-party advertising companies also separately place or recognize a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to the Site. These companies may use non-personal information collected by the cookies about your visits to the Site and other web sites in order to provide you with advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 
<p>
The Site contains links to web sites of third parties. PriceGrabber is not responsible for the actions of these third parties, including their privacy practices and any content posted on their web sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personal information. PriceGrabber adheres to industry recognized standards to secure any personal information in our possession, and to secure it from unauthorized access and tampering. However, as is true with all online actions, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions of personal information, or other users of the Site may misuse or abuse your personal information that they may collect from the Site. 
<p>
PriceGrabber uses third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Site. These third-party advertising companies employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gifs or web beacons to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our website and other websites, but will not collect any information which can personally identify you or can be linked to you. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, and the IP address. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. 
<p>
If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from collecting data, currently you may either visit each ad network's web site individually and opt out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out of all network advertising cookies.

<strong>Privacy Statement for Users Transacting Using the Storefronts Service</strong>
<p>
If you participate in a transaction through the Storefronts Service, you should be aware that PriceGrabber will disclose certain of your personal information to the other transacting party as follows: 
<p>
If you are the seller or a buyer using the Storefronts Services, we may provide to the other party to the transaction your: complete name, e-mail and telephone number. 
<p>
In the event that a seller and a buyer in a Storefronts transaction agree to use a money order or cashiers check for transaction payment, the seller is obligated to receive payment at the address that matches the address for a valid credit card on file with PriceGrabber.
<p>
For transactional services available to our Members such as those involving our Storefronts Service, in addition to the above, we will request credit card information and additional personal data to PriceGrabber. PriceGrabber will provide the buyer with the seller's name and address, and seller must agree to the provision of this information to buyer by PriceGrabber to verify your identity. PriceGrabber may verify the information provided in membership applications by authorizing a charge on the credit card provided in the application, not to exceed $5.00, but PriceGrabber does not actually charge the credit card any money in the verification process. 
<p>
AS A SELLER USING THE STOREFRONTS SERVICE YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION WILL NEVER BE INTENTIONALLY DISCLOSED TO ANY OTHER MEMBER. PRICEGRABBER WILL NOT PASS THE BUYER'S CREDIT CARD INFORMATION TO THE SELLER IF THE BUYER CHOOSES TO PAY WITH A FORM OF PAYMENT OTHER THAN CREDIT CARD. WHEN USING THE STOREFRONTS SERVICE, PRICEGRABBER MAY DISCLOSE YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION TO THE SELLER, OR TO THE AGENTS THAT PROCESS THE SELLER'S CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS, ONLY IF YOU SELECT TO PAY VIA CREDIT CARD FOR YOUR PURCHASES. PRICEGRABBER MAY ALSO DISCLOSE A MEMBER'S CREDIT CARD INFORMATION TO THOSE COMPANIES THAT PRICEGRABBER USES TO AUTHORIZE AND PROCESS CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS.
