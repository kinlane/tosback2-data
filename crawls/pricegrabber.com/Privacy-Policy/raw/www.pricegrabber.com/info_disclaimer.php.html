        interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site or any sales being conducted through the
        Site. You agree that you will not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load
        on PriceGrabber&apos;s computer systems or communications infrastructure. You agree that you will not use any
        software robot, spider, other automatic device or manual process to monitor or copy Site pages or the content
        contained therein without PriceGrabber&apos;s prior written consent.
    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
        <strong>MERCHANT REVIEWS</strong>
    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may submit a merchant review through the Merchant Ratings System on the Site or through the
        Shopper Satisfaction Survey to describe your shopping experiences with merchants.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You may submit a merchant review only in good faith and about a merchant from whom you have actually
            purchased or attempted to purchase products, limited to where you have (i) completed the ordering process,
            (ii) exchanged payment data, and/or (iii) received an invoice number.
        </li>
        <li>You agree to submit the corresponding and legitimate invoice number or equivalent confirmation of order
            number/identifier when submitting the merchant review (&quot;Invoice Number&quot;). You acknowledge and agree that the
            Invoice Number will be made available by PriceGrabber to the applicable merchant in conjunction with your
            review, and accordingly, the merchant may be able to contact you regarding your review or otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>You may only describe your experience with the merchant for which you are writing a merchant review. You
            should not review any merchant on situations that are not controlled by the merchant you are reviewing.
        </li>
        <li>You may submit no more than one merchant review of a particular merchant in any thirty (30) day period.</li>
        <li>Any merchant review that you submit is subject to the conditions and restrictions described in the CONTENT
            SUBMISSION section, above.
        </li>
        <li>You acknowledge and agree that PriceGrabber may, in its sole discretion, post only the first ten (10)
            merchant reviews it receives from users (which may not include your review) that are related, on a case by
            case basis and in whole or in part, to a product or service listing error by a merchant, such as, but not
            limited to, an error in the price of a product(s) or a service, the number of units of a product(s)
            available for a certain price, the shipping rates for product(s), or inventory levels.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Upon becoming aware of the same, PriceGrabber will omit any merchant review that it determines
        on the face of the review (only) violates any requirements in this Terms of Use or the Member Agreement.
        PriceGrabber will not itself edit or modify the contents of a merchant review; it will only remove a review in
        accordance with the foregoing.
    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By providing the Invoice Number, you acknowledge and agree that you may be contacted by
        PriceGrabber and/or the applicable merchant to which/whom the invoice relates. You acknowledge and agree that
        your review may not be displayed if the Invoice Number does not match the associated information in
        PriceGrabber&apos;s records. A merchant may dispute the validity of an invoice identified by you and may submit a
        complaint to PriceGrabber. This may result in PriceGrabber opening a user review inquiry. During the user review
        inquiry, PriceGrabber may, in its sole discretion, remove the contested review, and/or require additional data
        or proof from the user to determine whether the review should remain or be reinstated on the Site. Failure of
        the user to participate in the user review inquiry will result in the removal of the contested review from the
        Site.
    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In order to submit a merchant review you may be required to have a Confirmed Member Account or
        higher (as

        <strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong>
    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
        These Terms of Use and Privacy Statement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
        State of California, without regard to principles of conflicts or choice of law. In addition, the application of
        the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, including any amendments
        thereto, is expressly excluded hereby. Except for disputes arising from an alleged violation of intellectual
        property rights or breach of confidentiality, for which the injured party may suffer irreparable harm and may
        seek a restraining order, preliminary injunctive relief, an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
        relief and/or legal remedies, and actions to enforce the decisions of the arbitrators, for which action may be
        taken in any court of competent jurisdiction, all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement,
        including the scope, the construction or application of this Agreement, shall be resolved by arbitration in
        accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association then in force. The
        arbitration hearings and all meetings pursuant to this section shall be held in Los Angeles, California, USA,
        and shall be conducted in English. If the parties cannot agree upon a single arbitrator within fifteen (15) days
        after demand by either of them, each party shall select one arbitrator knowledgeable about Internet commerce in
        California and the USA generally, and notify the other of its selection, and such two arbitrators shall select a
        third from a list of arbitrators (with knowledge of the Internet industry) qualified by the American Arbitration
        Association in California. If this procedure for selecting arbitrators fails, then a neutral arbitrator based in
        California with knowledge of Internet commerce in California and the USA generally shall be selected by the
        American Arbitration Association to resolve the dispute. The arbitrator(s) shall conduct a hearing within thirty
        (30) days after their selection. A majority of the arbitrators (if there is more than one pursuant to this
        clause) shall determine the decision/award, which shall be rendered within five (5) days after the completion of
        the hearing. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the parties both as to law and to
        fact, and shall not be appealable to any court in any jurisdiction. The parties shall share the expenses of the
        arbitrators equally. Nothing in any indemnification provision hereunder shall be construed as having any bearing
        on the award of attorneys&apos; fees or arbitrators&apos; fees under this section.

    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
        At PriceGrabber.com Inc. (&quot;PriceGrabber&quot;) we want you to know exactly how and when we collect and use
        information that can specifically identify you, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, and email
        address (&quot;personal information&quot;).
    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
        We do not require that you provide, nor do we collect, any personal information if you are just browsing the
        Site. We may offer on the Site non-transactional and transaction based services (&quot;Service(s)&quot;) in which, subject
        to applicable terms and availability, you may participate (e.g., submitting product reviews or becoming a Member
        to buy or sell items through the Storefronts Service). In order to provide you with the Services you request,
        PriceGrabber may require that you first provide certain personal information, which we determine is reasonably
        necessary in order for us to fulfill your request. If you indicate an interest in participating in a Service, we
        will identify what specific personal information you must provide prior to collecting such information. Any
        personal information which we collect from you will only be used for the purposes identified in this Privacy
        Statement, the PriceGrabber Terms of Use and your applicable Member Agreement with PriceGrabber, and as may
        otherwise be indicated at the time the information is collected. To update, modify or delete any personal
        information you provide to us with respect to a Service you may access your account with PriceGrabber, make the
        changes on <A HREF="http://www.pricegrabber.com/account.php/settings/">http://www.pricegrabber.com/account.php/settings/</A>
        and submit the same to PriceGrabber.
    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
        PriceGrabber will not disclose your personal information to any third party unless: 1) it is necessary in order
        to provide you with a particular Service you have requested; 2) it is required of PriceGrabber in order to
        comply with a legal process in any applicable jurisdiction (e.g., court order, subpoena, search warrant, law
        enforcement request); 3) PriceGrabber determines, in its sole discretion, that disclosure is necessary to
        protect the rights, property, and safety of PriceGrabber, its subsidiaries, affiliates, co-brand partners or
        other parties under contract with PriceGrabber, our users, or others; or 4) you have provided such data through
        a partner&apos;s private-level shopping web site hosted by PriceGrabber, in which case PriceGrabber may provide your
        personal data to that partner (PriceGrabber is not responsible for its partners&apos; privacy policies or their use,
        storage and processing of data collected on their web sites). In addition, PriceGrabber may transmit information
        to a merchant, such as an invoice number, which may permit the merchant to deduce the identity of a
        user/reviewer in the event that a merchant disputes a user review on the grounds that a transaction never took
        place between the user and the merchant and/or an order was never made by the user in each case for the
        applicable product(s)/service(s).
    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
        In certain instances, PriceGrabber may request that you provide secondary information (e.g., demographic
        information), which we may use, for example, to learn more about our customers and to develop and improve our
        services. Any requests for secondary information will be marked &quot;optional&quot; (or its equivalent). We may compile
        your personal information with that collected from other customers to create aggregate data. Aggregate data is
        information about groups of customers and, once compiled, will in no way identify you as an individual. We may
        disclose aggregate data to our business affiliates, advertisers, and other parties.

    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
        In the event that a seller and a buyer in a Storefronts transaction agree to use a money order or cashiers check
        for transaction payment, the seller is obligated to receive payment at the address that matches the address for
        a valid credit card on file with PriceGrabber.
    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
        For transactional services available to our Members such as those involving our Storefronts Service, in addition
        to the above, we will request credit card information and additional personal data to PriceGrabber. PriceGrabber
        will provide the buyer with the seller&apos;s name and address, and seller must agree to the provision of this
        information to buyer by PriceGrabber to verify your identity. PriceGrabber may verify the information provided
        in membership applications by authorizing a charge on the credit card provided in the application, not to exceed
        $5.00, but PriceGrabber does not actually charge the credit card any money in the verification process.
    </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
        AS A SELLER USING THE STOREFRONTS SERVICE YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION WILL NEVER BE INTENTIONALLY DISCLOSED TO
        ANY OTHER MEMBER. PRICEGRABBER WILL NOT PASS THE BUYER&apos;S CREDIT CARD INFORMATION TO THE SELLER IF THE BUYER
        CHOOSES TO PAY WITH A FORM OF PAYMENT OTHER THAN CREDIT CARD. WHEN USING THE STOREFRONTS SERVICE, PRICEGRABBER
        MAY DISCLOSE YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION TO THE SELLER, OR TO THE AGENTS THAT PROCESS THE SELLER&apos;S CREDIT CARD
        PAYMENTS, ONLY IF YOU SELECT TO PAY VIA CREDIT CARD FOR YOUR PURCHASES. PRICEGRABBER MAY ALSO DISCLOSE A
        MEMBER&apos;S CREDIT CARD INFORMATION TO THOSE COMPANIES THAT PRICEGRABBER USES TO AUTHORIZE AND PROCESS CREDIT CARD
        PAYMENTS.
