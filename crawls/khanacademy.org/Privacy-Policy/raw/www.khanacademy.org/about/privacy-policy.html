<h3 style="margin: 40px 0;">Khan Academy's mission is to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.  We are a not-for-profit 501c3 entity, and our purpose of establishing ourselves as a non-profit entity is so that our mission of education and trust with the user never comes in conflict with a for-profit motive. We believe that this is necessary for us to be trusted with your private data.</h3>

<h2 class="main-headline">Khan Academy Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Last Updated: May 22, 2012</p>

<p>Welcome to the web site and online services (the "<b>Website</b>") operated by Khan Academy, Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization ("<b>Khan Academy</b>"). Khan Academy values the privacy of our members and others who visit and use the Website (individually, "<b>You</b>" or collectively, "<b>Users</b>"). We take your privacy seriously and make it a priority to protect personally identifiable information that we obtain from and about individuals both online and off-line.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it. By using the Website (whether or not you are a registered member), you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy. If you do not want information about you to be used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Khan Academy <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/about/tos">Terms of Service</a>. Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and Khan Academy's <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/about/tos">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<h3>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy:</h3>

<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Khan Academy puts in place certain features designed to help protect the personally identifiable information of children less than 13 years of age. Khan Academy does not knowingly permit any person less than 13 years of age to register directly for the Website unless Khan Academy reasonably believes the child's parent has consented to such registration and use of the Website. If Khan Academy learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected on the Website without parental consent, then Khan Academy will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with the Website without your consent, then you may alert Khan Academy at <a href="mailto:privacy@khanacademy.org">privacy@khanacademy.org</a> and request that Khan Academy delete that child's personal information from its systems.</p>

<h3>Child Registration:</h3>

<p>When a child under the age of 13 ("<b>Child Member</b>") requests to register for the Website, Khan Academy first seeks consent from the child's identified parent or guardian ("<b>Parent</b>"). During the initial registration process, we may collect from a potential Child Member their email address and birth date, along with an email address for a Parent. During this initial registration stage, we do not store the child's email address or birth date if we do not have parental consent for such Child Member's registration for the Website. Khan Academy attempts to inform the child's Parent, using an email address provided by the child, of the request for a Child Member account and directs the Parent to this Privacy Policy. If you are a Parent and wish to consent to your child's registration on the Website, you must first register for the Website under an adult account. If you are a registered Parent on the Website, you may create a child account for each Child Member for whom you are a legal parent or guardian. A Parent may additionally revoke a child's permission to use the Website at any time by either contacting Khan Academy at <a href="mailto:privacy@khanacademy.org">privacy@khanacademy.org</a> or by changing the password for the child's account using the features provided for a parent account. If you are a Parent and register your child for a Child Member account, you agree and acknowledge that you permit the Child Member to use the Website and all features made available on the Website as fully contemplated by Khan Academy. As a Parent, you understand that any personally identifiable information of your child that you provide in connection with registration or otherwise may be used by Khan Academy as provided in this Privacy Policy. Except where the context indicates otherwise, the remainder of this Privacy Policy (including any discussion of the personally identifiable information that Khan Academy may collect, use or disclose) shall apply equally to a Child Member account and a Parent account. The Website does not condition a Child Member's participation in an online activity on the Child Member providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity. </p>

<h3>The Information Khan Academy Collects</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>User-provided Information</b>: When you register for, browse and use the Website, you may provide to Khan Academy what is generally called "personally identifiable information" (such as your full name, email address, postal mailing address, and/or home/mobile telephone number). You may also be able to add a picture of yourself. If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third party social networking or authentication service that we may make available ("<b>Authentication Service</b>"), such as Facebook Connect or Google, Khan Academy may also collect any such "personally identifiable information" that you have provided to the Authentication Service from the account you have with the Authentication Service. You may revoke Khan Academy's access to your account on the Authentication Service at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective Authentication Service. From time to time, Khan Academy may also ask you optionally to provide other information. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving Khan Academy the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please understand that when you sign in with Khan Academy, you are not anonymous to us.</li>
<li><b>"Cookies" Information</b>: When you visit the Website, whether or not you are a registered member, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. Khan Academy may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access to certain services and features on the Website. Third party advertisements displayed in connection with the Website may also contain cookies set by internet advertisers. We do not control these cookies and users of the Website should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.</li>
<li><b>"Automatically Collected" Information:</b> When you use the Website, we may automatically record certain information from your browser by using different types of technology, including standard log files, "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, click stream data, operating system and the dates and times that you visit the Website. Additionally, we may record certain information regarding your use of features that Khan Academy may make available on the Website, such as the number of problems you have attempted, the number of videos you have viewed and the amount of time spent to complete a problem.</li>
<li><b>Third Party Web Beacons: </b>We may also implement third party content, such as advertising, on the Website that uses "clear gifs," "web beacons," or other similar techniques, which allow the third party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser, or implement similar tracking mechanisms, in connection with your viewing of that third party content displayed on the Website. This information is collected directly by the third party, and Khan Academy does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by third parties in this manner is subject to that third party's own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.</li>
<li><b>Information from Other Sources:</b>We may also obtain information, including personally identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than the Website. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personally identifiable information that we collect through the Website, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Way Khan Academy Uses Information</h3>

<ul>
<li>Khan Academy uses the information that you provide or that we collect in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. Khan Academy generally uses the information you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Website. If you have given Khan Academy consent, we may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with information about Khan Academy's features, services and other offerings that may be of interest to you. We may also send information or offers to groups of users on behalf of other businesses. Under certain circumstances (for example if you win a contest) we may post your personally identifiable information on the Website. However, we will notify you of this possibility when collecting personally identifiable information or we will obtain your consent. We may share your personally identifiable information with certain other websites that we link to (and that you click upon) in order to enhance your experience in connection with the Website.</li>
<li>Khan Academy uses all of the information that you provide or that we collect from Users to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Website works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.</li>
<li>Khan Academy may use "cookies" information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website; (b) provide customized third-party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities. </li>
<li>If you have registered as a member and given Khan Academy consent, we may share your personally identifiable information with advertisers, business partners, and other entities that are not affiliated with Khan Academy who would like to send you information about their products and services. We do not share personally identifiable information with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in.</li>
<li>Khan Academy's employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to the personally identifiable information you may provide to register as a member of Khan Academy. We may share your personally identifiable information with companies that provide services to us, including outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (for example, contest and sweepstakes administration), but they may only use your personally identifiable information to provide us with a specific service and not for any other purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Khan Academy Discloses Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Aggregate Information:</b> Khan Academy discloses automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information to interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Website.</li>
    <li><b>User Postings on the Website:</b> Khan Academy enables you to share your User Postings with other Users of the Website, such as Users of the Website that you choose to register as your Coach and Users associated with your Educational Organization. Khan Academy may also permit you to share your User Postings publicly on the Website. If your User Postings are shared with other Users, any personally identifiable information that you choose to include in, or is associated with, such User Postings will be accessible by such Users. Once you make your personally identifiable information available to others in any of these ways, <i>it may be collected and used by the recipients without restriction</i>. Khan Academy enables Users to share information and resources. If you are a User subscribing to the Website and you consent, Khan Academy may disclose certain personally identifiable information to other Users of the Website, such as Users registered as Coaches and Users associated with your Educational Organization. If you consent, Khan Academy may also share information about your use of certain Website features with other Users of the Website, such as sharing your activity history with your Coach or Users associated with your Educational Organization.</li>
    <li><b>Child Member Information:</b> Although Khan Academy makes available certain features that allow a User to disclose personal information to other Users, we attempt to restrict a Child Member's access to certain features that could result in disclosure by the Child Member of personally identifiable information. For example, a Child Member account is not normally permitted to post public comments on the Website for any videos or exercises. However, some features of the Website may permit a Child Member to enter free-form text through which the Child Member could include personally identifiable information that could be visible to other Users (such as when a Child Member enters personal information in answering an exercise problem or creating other projects on the Website). Further, certain features of the Website may allow the Child Member to communicate with other Users, such as when a Child Member communicates with a Coach through the Website or through third party services accessing the Khan Academy API. If the Child Member chooses to include personally identifiable information in such communications, the recipient may be able to collect and use such information without restriction. For example, a Coach may receive personally identifiable information that is made available by a Child Member and may be able to use such information without restriction.</li>
    <li><b>Social Networks:</b> Khan Academy will disclose your personal information if you have explicitly agreed that we may do so. In particular, we will disclose personal information where you have elected to connect your account on our Website to a social network or other similar service (e.g., Facebook or Google), or have elected to have your activity on our Website published to a social network or other similar service (e.g., Facebook or Google). To control the information that you share, you should review and, if appropriate, modify your privacy settings on such services.</li>
    <li><b>Required by Law:</b> Khan Academy may also disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant. In some cases, we may make such disclosures without first providing notice to Users. </li>
    <li><b>Merger or Acquisition:</b> In the event that Khan Academy is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</li>
    <li><b>Other Purposes:</b> Khan Academy also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect Khan Academy from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Website; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Khan Academy, our Users, or others.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your Choices:</h3>

<p>You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Khan Academy, in which case Khan Academy will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Website. If you register as a member of Khan Academy, you may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by going to your account settings page.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times. </p>

<h3>Third Party Applications</h3>

<p>Khan Academy endeavors to make the educational videos and content available through Website as broadly available as possible. To encourage this, Khan Academy makes available to third party application developers and service providers ("<b>App Developers</b>") an application programming interface ("<b>API</b>") for use in creating complementary or additional services for users (such as creating mobile applications that provide access to Khan Academy content). Through the API, Khan Academy may allow App Developers to access a variety of personal information related to your use of the Website and related services, including your username or other unique identifier, messages, comments, browsing history on the Website, exercise history and other information related to your use of the Website. When you use, download or access an application or service from such App Developers, we may give them access to such personal information you have provided or we have collected. The first time an App Developer wishes to access your information through the API for a particular service or application, you will first be given the option to approve such access to your information by such service or application. You understand that you may not have access to certain features or services if you choose to not provide such access to your information to App Developers. </p>
<p>You understand and agree that such App Developers may use this information for its internal business purposes in operating its services and may also disclose such information to its other customers and users. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party services and application. Khan Academy's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such App Developers.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h3>

<p>The Website may be linked to internet websites operated by other companies. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. Khan Academy may also permit other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, some of the advertisements and links that appear on the Website. These advertisers may automatically receive your IP address if this happens. These advertisers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party websites and third party ad servers or ad networks. Khan Academy's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other third party advertisers or web sites. Please be aware that Khan Academy does not warn you when you have chosen to link through to another website from the Website.</p>

<h3>Our Commitment to Data Security</h3>

<p>Khan Academy uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Khan Academy, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Khan Academy makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. </p>

<p>If Khan Academy learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Khan Academy may post a notice on the Website if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. </p>

<h3>International Visitors</h3>

<p>The Website is intended solely for visitors located within the United States. If you nonetheless choose to use the Website from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personally identifiable information outside of those regions to the United States and by providing your personally identifiable information on the Website you consent to that transfer.</p>

<h3>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We reserve the right to change the privacy policy at our sole discretion. Khan Academy users will be informed of any such change by us posting a new privacy policy on the Website and the effective date of any change of privacy policy will be clearly marked. We will not use any personally identifiable information of yours in ways that are materially different from the ones described in this Privacy Policy without also providing notification of such practices and obtaining consent to any such different uses. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our Website.</p>
