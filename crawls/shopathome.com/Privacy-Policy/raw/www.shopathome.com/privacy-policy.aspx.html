In order to do this, our Shopping Toolbar gathers data about your searches and browsing activities – we combine and compare this information with the other information we collect and maintain about you.  If you do not wish ShopAtHome.com to continue to collect this information about your browsing and search history, you must uninstall the Shopping Toolbar.
