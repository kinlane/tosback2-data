			<h2>Kinetic Glue Privacy Policy</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Kinetic Glue&#8217;s (hereinafter &#8216;KGO&#8217; or &#8216;Company&#8217;) Privacy Policy is designed to address your specific needs and to help You understand how we collect and use the personal information You decide to share, and help You make informed decisions when using the Website located at <a href="http://www.kineticglue.com/" target="_blank">www.kineticglue.com</a> and its directly associated domains (collectively, &#8221; KGO-&#8221; or &#8220;Website&#8221;).</p>

However, You may not visit and use our site at anytime without telling us who You are or revealing the required information about Yourself. To the Company, our most important asset is our relationship with You. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of any personal information about our users. We are proud of our privacy practices and the strength of our site security and want You to know how we protect Your information and use it to provide to You the services. This notice describes our privacy policy.</p>

<p>If You have questions or concerns regarding this statement, You should first contact our privacy staff at <a href="mailto:support@kineticglue.com">support@kineticglue.com</a>. Since this policy will change from time to time, please read it regularly.</p>
<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong><br />
When You visit the Website KGO You provide us with two types of information: personal information You knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and Web Site use information collected by us as You interact with our Web Site.</p>
<p>Information You give Us. We receive any information You enter on our Website or give us in any other way. For example: When You register with the Website , You provide us with certain personal information, such as Your name, Your email address, Your telephone number, Your address, Your gender, Your work history, schools and colleges attended and any other personal or preference information, as may be required and to the extent applicable.</p>
<p>However, we do not store any personal sensitive information on our server and they always remain with You on Your system.</p>
<p>You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that You Provide for such purposes as responding to Your requests, customizing, improving our data base, and communicating with You and utilizing/exploiting/disclosing, without prejudice to any of Your other rights, the same for any other, whether commercial or non-commercial purpose which the Company in its sole discretion considers necessary for its business purposes or otherwise.</p>
<p>You can add or update certain information. When You update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.</p>
<p>When you enter the Website, we collect Your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all our Website KGO visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using &#8220;cookies.&#8221;</p>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user&#8217;s computer tied to information about the user. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to Your computer&#8217;s hard drive through Your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize Your browser and to provide certain features.</p>
<p>The &#8220;help&#8221; portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell You how to prevent Your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify You when You receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow You to take full advantage of some of our best and updated features, and we recommend that You leave them turned on.</p>
<p>We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores Your login ID (but not Your password) to make it easier for You to login when You come back to our Website. KGO You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in Your browser if You want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
<p>When You use our Website, You may set up Your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, set up events, add applications, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide You the service and offer personalized features. Predominantly, this information is retained for Your benefit wherein, You can return to view prior messages You have sent or easily see Your friend list. When You update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that You post User Content (as defined in the KGO Terms &amp;Conditions) on the Website at Your own risk and own discretion. Although we allow You to set privacy options that limit access to Your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom You may choose to share Your pages and information with. Therefore, there can be no guarantee regarding unauthorized User Content.</p>
<p>Although we adopt and utilize the best practices regarding safety and security we do not and cannot guarantee and are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. You acknowledge and agree that irrespective of whether the User Content is removed or becomes redundant, some of them may still be retained in archives or may be cached or may have been stored by any third party accessing the same. In such scenarios or eventuality, we cannot be held responsible or liable for the same.</p>
<p>Any improper, unauthorized collection or misuse of information provided on KGOthe Website will be considered a material breach and is a violation of the KGO Terms of Service and should be reported to immediately <a href="mailto:support@kineticglue.com">support@kineticglue.com</a> .</p>
<p>If You choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask You for information needed to send the invitation, such as Your friend&#8217;s email address. We will automatically send Your friend a one-time email or instant message inviting him or her to visit the site. We store this information to send this one-time invitation, to register a friend connection if Your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@kineticglue.com">support@kineticglue.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p>KGO We may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the KGO Website service through the operation of the service (e.g., photo tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.</p>
<p>By using our Website KGO, You are expressly consenting to have Your personal data transferred to and processed in India and in any location where KGO would host servers to process the same.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information Obtained by KGO</strong><br />
When you register with our Website, You create Your own profile and privacy settings. Your personally identifiable information including Your profile information, as well as Your name, email and photo, gender, birth date, occupation, personal interests , demographic information are displayed to people in the networks specified in Your privacy settings to enable You to connect with people on the Website. We may occasionally use Your name and email address to send You notifications regarding new services offered by us that we think You may find valuable.</p>
<p>Profile information is used by KGO and the Website primarily to be presented back to and edited by You when You access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by Your privacy settings. In some cases where Your privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to Your wall), other Website users may be able to supplement Your profile.</p>
<p>Profile information You submit to the Website will be available to users of the Website who belong to at least one of the networks You allow to access the information through Your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of friends). Your name, network names, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Website network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so Your friends can find You and send a friend request. People who see Your name in searches, however, will not be able to access Your profile information unless they have a relationship with You (friend, friend of friend, member of Your networks, etc.) that allows such access based on Your privacy settings.</p>
<p>KGO may send You service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For instance, if a friend sends You a new message or initiates any other interaction, You may receive an email alerting You to that fact.</p>
<p>Generally, You may opt out of such emails, though KGO reserves the right to send You notices about Your account even if You opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>
<p>KGO may use information in Your profile without specifically identifying You as an individual to third parties. KGO does this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a network like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide You the full set of benefits which KGO proposes to offer. You can know more about the world around You and, where there are advertisements, they&#8217;re more likely to be interesting to You. For example, if You put a favorite tutor in your profile, we might serve You an advertisement highlighting a similar one in Your town. But we don&#8217;t tell the tutor who You are.</p>
<p>We may use information about You that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, KGO Special Developers and other users of KGO, to supplement Your profile. Where such information is used, we generally allow You to specify in Your privacy settings that You do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to Your profile (e.g., removing photo tag links).</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</strong><br />
KGO is about sharing information with others &#8211; friends and people in Your networks &#8211; while providing You with privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing Your information. We allow You to choose the information You provide to friends and networks through KGO. Our network architecture and Your privacy settings allow You to make informed choices about who has access to Your information. We do not provide contact information to third party marketers without Your permission. We share Your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by You or 4) required by a court order; or 5) to protect KGO&#8217;s rights and property, (3) to protect against unauthorized use of KGO Website site, and (4) during emergencies such as when we believe someone&#8217;s physical safety is at risk. For example:</p>
<p>We share Your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by You or 4) required by a court order; or 5) to protect KGO&#8217;s rights and property, (3) to protect against unauthorized use of KGO Website site, and (4) during emergencies such as when we believe someone&#8217;s physical safety is at risk. For example: You may aggregate the information You provide and make it available to Your friends and network members according to Your visibility settings. You may set Your preferences for You on Your profile page.</p>
<p>Also, certain technical processing of messages and their content may be required to: (1) send and receive messages; (2) conform to connecting networks&#8217; technical requirements; (3) conform to the limitations of the service; or (4) conform to other similar requirements.</p>
<p>It is possible that as we continue to develop the Website and business, and/or related assets may be acquired. In such a transaction, all our customer information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.</p>
<p>Unlike most sites on the Web, KGO limits access to site information by third party search engine &#8220;crawlers&#8221; (e.g. Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask). KGO takes action to block access by these engines to personal information beyond Your name, profile picture, and limited aggregated data about Your profile (e.g. number of wall postings). But You acknowledge and agree that at times this may be beyond the control of KGO.</p>
<p>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring You the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about KGO, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to Your personal information for use for a limited time and limited purpose in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the KGO-specified purposes.</p>
<p>If You, Your friends, or members of Your network use any third-party applications or widgets developed using the KGO Technology Base (&#8220;Special Applications&#8221;), those Special Applications may access and share certain information about You with others in accordance with Your privacy settings. You may opt-out of any sharing of certain or all information through Special Applications on the Account Settings page. In addition, third party developers who have created and operate Special Applications (&#8220;Special Developers&#8221;), may also have access to Your personal information (excluding your contact information) if You permit Special Applications to access Your data. Before allowing any Special Developer to make any Special Application available to You, KGO requires the Special Developer to enter into an agreement which, among other things, requires them to respect Your privacy settings and strictly limits their collection, use, and storage of Your information. However, while we have undertaken contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such Special Developers, we of course cannot and do not guarantee that all Special Developers will abide by such agreements. Please note that KGO does not screen or approve or disapprove or advertise or endorse Special Developers and cannot control how such Special Developers use any personal information that they may obtain in connection with Special Applications. In addition, Special Developers may require You to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies, which may give them additional rights or impose additional obligations on You, so please make sure to review these terms and policies carefully before using any Special Application. KGO will not be responsible or liable and is not aware of the contents of such terms of service, privacy policies or other policies of these Special Developers You can report any suspected misuse of information through the KGO Technology Base and we will use our reasonable efforts investigate any such claim and take appropriate action against the Special Developer up to and including terminating their participation in the KGO Technology Base and/or other formal legal action. This is the final and only legal remedy available to You in this regard from KGO.</p>
<p>We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the KGO world. Such accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit possible misuse.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the KGO service or using the KGO name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>
<p>We let You choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored groups or other on-site offers.</p>
<p>We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on KGO. You can tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided on KGO, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service.</p>
<p>KGO can share actions You have taken on third party sites, such as when You make a purchase or post a review, with your friends on KGO. In order to provide you as a KGO user with clear disclosure of the activity information being collected on third party sites and potentially shared with Your friends on KGO, we collect certain information from that site and present it to You after You have completed an action on that site. You have the choice to have KGO discard that information, or to share it with Your friends.</p>
<p>Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even if You are logged out from KGO, or that pertains to non-KGO users, from those sites in conjunction with the technical operation of the system. In cases where KGO receives information on users that are not logged in, or on non-KGO users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual KGO accounts and will discard it.</p>
<p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the KGO business, or individual business units owned by KGO, Inc., were to change, Your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, Your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When You use KGO, certain information You post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or someone in your network), such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, videos, classified listings or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All such sharing of information is done at Your own risk.
