<h2 id="types-of-personal-information-we-collect">1. Types of Personal Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Personal Information is information that can be used to identify, locate, or contact an individual or an Affiliate. It also includes other information that may be associated with Personal Information. We collect the following types of Personal Information:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Contact Information</strong> that allows us to communicate with you, such as your name, postal addresses, email addresses, social media website user account names, telephone numbers, or other addresses at which you receive communications from or on behalf of RetailMeNot.</li>
	<li><strong>Relationship Information</strong> that helps us to understand who you are and what types of coupons you might like. This includes lifestyle information; location information related to your state/province, city, or neighborhood; the types of coupons that interest you; information collected from social media interactions (such as via Facebook Connect); and demographic information (e.g., birth date, age, gender).</li>
	<li><strong>Transaction Information</strong> about how you interact with RetailMeNot, such as the coupons you view and redeem; other information about how you use our Sites, email, other communications, and applications; and how you interact with RetailMeNot merchants, business partners, and service providers.</li>
	<li><strong>Mobile Location Information</strong> to help us offer you coupons for merchants nearby, if you have activated one of our mobile applications and permitted your mobile or other location-aware device to transmit location data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-rmn-collects-personal-information">2. How RetailMeNot Collects Personal Information</h2>
<p>We ask you for Personal Information (including Contact Information and Relationship Information) when you register, subscribe, create an account, or otherwise interact with the Sites or contact RetailMeNot. You are required to submit Contact Information in order to sign up for Card-Linked Offers on our Site.</p>
<p>We collect Transaction Information when you use our Site. For example, we may track the coupons you view or redeem, and the comments you make to the forums, bulletin boards, discussion groups, chat rooms or other methods of communication that may be offered on or through the Site from time to time (collectively "<strong><em>Communities</em></strong>"), or to those related to our social media pages or accounts. We use cookies and related technologies to collect information about your computer and your interaction with the Site and our business partner websites. You can read more about cookies and other technologies in the <a href="index.html#cookies-and-related-technologies">Cookies and Related Technologies</a> section.</p>
<p>We also collect Transaction Information if you contact us via telephone, email, text, postal mail, social media interaction, or other methods of communication, such as for customer support purposes.</p>
<p>If you use a social media platform or your mobile device (or other method of communication) to interact with RetailMeNot or the Sites, the application may have a specific privacy statement that governs the use of Personal Information related to that application. For example, if you use a RetailMeNot mobile application and your mobile device's settings allow it, we may collect Mobile Location Information from your device. Our application may be designed to collect information even if you are not logged into the RetailMeNot application or the Sites. If you have questions about the security and privacy settings of your mobile device, please refer to instructions from your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.</p>
<p>We may receive additional Personal Information from third parties. We may use this Personal Information to enhance other information we have about you to help us better understand you and to otherwise enhance the Sites or RetailMeNot services.</p>

<h2 id="cookies-and-related-technologies">5. Cookies and Related Technologies</h2>
<p>When you use our Sites, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use our Sites and applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information.</p>
<p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to our Sites by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.</p>
<p>For example, when you visit our Sites, RetailMeNot and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. A "<strong><em>cookie</em></strong>" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Sites. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your Site activity with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Sites.</p>
<p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. "<strong><em>Session</em></strong>" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser. "<strong><em>Persistent</em></strong>" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences.</p>
<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.</p>
<p>We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Sites, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol ("<strong><em>IP</em></strong>") addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Sites. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Site and the website you visit after you leave our Site, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.</p>
<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about Site users to optimize our Sites and understand its traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. In that case, this Privacy Statement governs how we use that information.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive Location Information, we will collect that automatically. If we associate Location Information with other Personal Information, this Privacy Statement governs how we would use that information too.</p>
