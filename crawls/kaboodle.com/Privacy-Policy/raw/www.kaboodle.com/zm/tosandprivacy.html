								<h5>Privacy Policy</h5>
								<h6>Purpose of this Privacy Policy</h6>
								<p>This privacy policy describes how Kaboodle and its service known as The Covetry treat the personally identifiable information that is collected about you when you visit the web sites to which this policy is linked. Kaboodle and The Covetry are referred to collectively as Kaboodle.</p>
								<h6>What is Personally Identifiable Information</h6>
								<p>"Personally identifiable information" is information that we can use to identify you as an individual. Personally identifiable information includes your name, address, telephone number and any other information that is connected with you personally.</p>
								<h6>Information This Privacy Policy Does Not Apply To</h6>
								<p>This privacy policy does not apply to information collected about you by anyone except Kaboodle and only applies to the web sites to which this policy is linked. Any information you provide when you visit web sites other than those covered by this policy (including other web sites affiliated with Kaboodle's parent company, Hearst Communications, Inc.) or when you purchase any products or services, or enter contests, that may be linked to or advertised on our web site by companies other than Kaboodle is subject to the privacy policies posted on those sites. Except as may be otherwise specified herein, this policy also does not apply to information you may provide to us offline.</p>
								<h6>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</h6>
								<ol>
									<li>Kaboodle generally collects personally identifiable information with your specific knowledge and consent. When you register on Kaboodle, we collect your email address, username, and password. These are required for users to store and modify bookmarks and other content on the site. We will also collect your bookmarks and associated content, messages, IP address, and information from browser data and cookies.</li>
									<li>Your User ID, bookmarks, lists and associated content and any postings you make to message boards are displayed throughout the Site. Therefore this data is available to the public and will be identifiable to your User ID. You can choose to make your bookmarks and lists private by going to the list setting page for each list. A user may email lists to other users by using the email function and therefore Kaboodle collects these email addresses for the purpose of sending lists and populating a user's address book.</li>
									<li>This information may sometimes be collected by third party service providers with whom Kaboodle contracts to host the web site or to fulfill requests for services; in that event, Kaboodle asks such service providers to make the personal information available only to Kaboodle for Kaboodle to use in accordance with the terms of this policy and not to use the information for any other purpose. Kaboodle uses this information to allow you to enjoy the functionality of the site, to troubleshoot and to provide customer support. In addition, Kaboodle may use your bookmarks to improve our marketing and promotional efforts by providing targeted advertising based on the content of the lists.</li>
									<li>We do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. However, if you elect to become a "fan" of a Brand Profile Page (meaning a page in the Kaboodle community that displays brands, products or goods of a merchant) the administrator of the page (known as "Brand Admin") may send you in-system messages containing commercial and promotional messages (for more details, and information on how to opt out, see the section called "Contacts with Brand Profile Pages" below). If you send an email using the service to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email. We do not rent or sell these email addresses, nor do we send them marketing messages.</li>
									<li>Other users may send emails and in-system messages to you via the Kaboodle service. Kaboodle does not review these messages before they are sent to you. You may block in-system messages from specific users by visiting the user's page and clicking on the "block user" button on the user's profile. You may manage your email preferences by clicking here.</li>
									<li>On an aggregate, non-personally identifiable level we may also use this data to analyze site usage, customize the site's content, layout, and services, and for disclosure to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes and to demonstrate to them the value of our own site. However, we do not sell or rent any of your personally identifying data to third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
									<li>When you register for the first time on Kaboodle, you will be automatically opted in to receive in-system and email notices, which may include notification if someone sends you a message or invites you to join a Kaboodle list or group, new friend requests, Kaboodle newsletters and announcements, notification of new activity on your lists, and notices about public Kaboodle activity by your friends. You may elect to opt out of receiving those messages at any time by clicking here.</li>
									<li>When you transfer to the site outside of the Kaboodle network, including a retailer affiliate of The Covetry, your shopping activity will be conducted on their site, and in accordance with that merchant's own privacy policy and terms of service. Kaboodle has no control over those policies, so you should carefully review them before you conduct any business on a third party site. Kaboodle shall have no liability for any commercial transactions you conduct on a merchant's site, and you hereby release Kaboodle for any claims, liabilities or damages of any nature as a result of such activities.</li>
									<li>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.</li>
									<li>In addition to the foregoing, Kaboodle may share or disclose personally identifiable information about you to other companies or individuals when:
										<ul class="arrows">
											<li>we utilize third party service providers to provide products, services or functions on our behalf (such as sending emails or processing credit cards or fulfilling subscriptions), and ask these service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information and not to use your personally identifiable information for any reason except to carry out the purpose(s) for which we hired them;</li>
											<li>you have entered a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, in which case the information may be shared with that third party for their use in their discretion, including direct marketing. (Some of our contests and sweeps will ask you at the time of entry whether you would like your personal information to be shared with the sponsor. Other contests will not give you that option and in that event, if you do not want your information to be shared, you should not enter the contest);</li>
											<li>the entity to whom the information is disclosed is one under control of, or under common control with Kaboodle (for these purposes, a company controlling 20% or more of the voting stock of another entity shall be deemed to control such entity);</li>
											<li>you have furnished us personal information with the intent that it be forwarded to a third party for use in connection with a specified service you are electing to participate in (examples include, without limitation, e-commerce partners, services to help old friends locate you online, etc.);</li>
											<li>we need to protect our legal rights (for example, if we are trying to collect money you owe us);</li>
											<li>we must comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal or regulatory process;</li>
											<li>we have reason to believe that someone may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or the rights of our users, or general public, or using our services in violation of a legal or personal right; or</li>
											<li>in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the web sites to which this policy applies.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ol>
								<h6>Cookies</h6>
								<p>Kaboodle (or third party service providers on our behalf) may set and access cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data (often including a unique identifier), that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Kaboodle uses cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our site.</p>
								<p>We may use cookies, IP address and browser data to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the sites, to deliver editorial content, and to personalize information.</p>
								<p>Our cookies may contain personally identifiable information and such cookies may be shared with others to the same extent indicated above.</p> 
								<p>Kaboodle (or third party service providers on our behalf) may also use cookies to collect aggregate information about web site users on an anonymous basis.  We may share aggregate demographic and usage information with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and other third parties for any business purpose.</p>
								<p>Some of our advertisers may serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.</p>
								<p>If you don't want cookies, most Web browsers include an option that allows you to not accept them. However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some portions of our sites may not function efficiently.</p>

No sales transactions will be conducted on those pages (you will still be transferred to a merchant's own e-commerce site for that purpose) but if you elect to become a fan of a Brand Profile Page, you will be agreeing to receive commercial messages from that Brand Admin, and that Brand Admin may send commercial and promotional messages to you at your Kaboodle account. You can opt out of receiving those messages by following instructions that will appear on the in-system message.</p>
								<h6>Blogs, Videos and other user-generated Postings; Social Networking</h6>
								<p>If you elect to post material to any blogs, forums, channels or other community boards that may be offered on our sites, or if you elect to upload any photographs, audio or video, you will be solely responsible for all content, messages, text, files, images, graphics, photos, audio clips, sounds, video or other materials (the "Postings").

You also acknowledge that visitors to the sites may post comments about your Postings which may be derogatory, and that Kaboodle has no obligation to monitor or delete any such postings.</p>
								<p>Please be aware that Kaboodle does not and cannot monitor all of the Postings made to the sites, and therefore Kaboodle will not be responsible for the content of any Postings. However, Kaboodle does reserve the right to delete or edit any material in any Posting that is obscene, harassing, offensive or otherwise objectionable and not in keeping with the community standards of the site. If Kaboodle elects to edit any Postings, it nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the content of the Postings.  Under no circumstances will Kaboodle be liable for any inaccuracy or defect in any Postings. We also expect our users to adhere to certain rules of the road. Therefore, you agree not to post, email, or otherwise make available Postings:</p>    
								<ul class="arrows">
								<li>that are unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, pornographic, libelous, or invasive of another's privacy, or harmful to minors in any way; </li>
								<li>that harass, degrade, intimidate or are hateful toward an individual or group of individuals on the basis of religion, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, age, or disability; </li>
								<li>that include personal or identifying information about another person without that person's explicit consent. </li>
								<li>that are false, deceptive, misleading, deceitful, misinformative, constitute "bait and switch" or impersonation of any person or entity;</li>
								<li>contain your own or a third party's advertising, branding or promotional content; </li>
								<li>that infringe any proprietary rights, including copyright, of any party, or Postings that you do not have a right to make available;</li>
								<li>restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Kaboodle sites or the Kaboodle services offered on them.</li>
								<li>that relate to products that sexual or pornographic in nature, alcoholic products, tobacco products or other products that are unlawful in any manner.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Because Kaboodle does not monitor the Postings, you agree to use and rely on them at your own risk. Kaboodle cannot make any representation or warranty about the material contained in the Postings.  Kaboodle likewise assumes no responsibility for any contact you may have with other users of our sites, either online or offline.  If you elect to meet in person with someone you may meet on our sites, you do so at your own risk, and under no circumstances will Kaboodle be liable for any activity or injury that may occur.</p>
