                <h4>Web Site Users</h4>
                
                <p>ChristianPost.com generally collects personally identifiable information such as a name, postal address, E-mail address, telephone number, or credit card information with your specific knowledge and consent.</p>
                
                <h4>How does the Web site use information supplied by me?</h4>
                
                <p>Occasionally, visitors to our Web site may be asked to supply certain personally identifying information, which is then retained by ChristianPost.com. For example, we ask you for certain information if you choose to subscribe to our E-mail newsletters, register with our online discussion forums, or purchase either articles from our archives or our premium online content. If you choose to give us personally identifying information at such time, such information will be retained by us and used only to provide you with products or services you have requested, or with additional information from ChristianPost.com about ChristianPost.com, its affiliates, or selected outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of use to you. Any information from selected outside companies will be transmitted by ChristianPost.com so that such companies will not have access either to your E-mail address or to your other personally identifying information. Moreover, we will not sell or rent any personally identifying information obtained through the Web site to any other company or organization.</p>
                
                <p>If, at some point after giving ChristianPost.com your personally identifying information, you do not wish to continue to receive additional information from ChristianPost.com about ChristianPost.com, its affiliates, or selected outside companies, in general, you may opt out by submitting a request via our <span class="fBlue"><a href="http://www.christianpost.com/aboutus/contactus.html">Contact Us page</a></span> with the words "remove my name" in the subject line of your E-mail; in the case of our E-mail newsletters, you also may follow the procedures at our E-mail newsletter registration page.</p>
                
                <p>From time to time, the personally identifying information that you provide to us may be shared with our suppliers or service providers who assist us in maintaining and managing our newsletters, our archives, our premium online content, our online discussion forums, and other activities on the Web site. Such suppliers or service providers may use your personally identifying information only in the course of providing services to ChristianPost.com, but they may not use such information for other purposes.</p>
                
                <p>While your individual information is protected as discussed above, ChristianPost.com reserves the right to use such individual information to create aggregated, anonymous data about users in order to develop statistics about activity on and visitors to the Web site. In addition, ChristianPost.com may disclose personal information if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Web site; or (4) protect the personal safety, property, or rights of our users or the public.</p>
                <h4>What are "cookies" and how do you use them?</h4>
                
                <p>"Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed by a Web site in a storage place on your computer. Cookies do not contain information that is, in itself, personally identifying. ChristianPost.com places cookies on your computer in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to calculate unique site visitors, and to track usage throughout our site. Other uses include placement of cookies to make the login process more convenient for users of our E-mail newsletters, our archives, our premium online content, and our online discussion forums. In addition, some advertisers may place cookies on your computer. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.</p>
                <h4>How is my credit card information used when I make a purchase?</h4>
                
                <p>When you make a purchase, we ask you to provide your credit card information so that we can process your payment. During the ordering process, such credit card information is transmitted to ChristianPost.com (in the case of our premium online content) or (in the case of our archives, subscriptions, and mail order products) to one of our suppliers or service providers. In both cases, credit card information is then transmitted to third-party credit card processors and card issuers that must use your information to process your order.</p>
                <h4>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
                
                <p>No one under the age of 13 should provide any personal information. In general, ChristianPost.com does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If in limited circumstances we do knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we will do so only with verified parental consent prior to collection. In the event that we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete this information from our database as quickly as possible. If you believe the Web site has any information about anyone under 13, please contact us via our <span class="fBlue"><a href="http://www.christianpost.com/aboutus/contactus.html">Contact Us page.</a></span></p>
