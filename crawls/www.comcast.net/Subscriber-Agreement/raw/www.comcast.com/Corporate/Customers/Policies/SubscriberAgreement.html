<p dfcmhtmlarea="Top section" dfcmeditable="True">We may change our prices, fees, the Service(s) and/or the terms and conditions of this Agreement in the future. Unless this Agreement or applicable law specifies otherwise, we will give you thirty (30) days prior notice of any significant change to this Agreement. If you find the change unacceptable, you have the right to cancel your Service(s).

<h2 dfcmhtmlarea="Top section" dfcmeditable="True">GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
<p dfcmhtmlarea="Top section" dfcmeditable="True"><strong>1. ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT<br />
</strong>You will have accepted this Agreement and be bound by its terms if you use the Service(s) or otherwise indicate your affirmative acceptance of such terms.</p>
<p dfcmhtmlarea="Top section" dfcmeditable="True"><strong>2. CHARGES AND BILLINGS</strong></p>
<blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr" dfcmhtmlarea="Top section" dfcmeditable="True">
<p><strong>a. Charges, Fees, and Taxes You Must Pay.</strong> You agree to pay all charges associated with the Service(s), including, but not limited to, installation/service call charges, monthly service charges, Xfinity Equipment (as defined below) charges, measured and per call charges, applicable federal, state, and local taxes and fees (however designated), regulatory recovery fees for municipal, state and federal government fees or assessments imposed on Comcast, permitted fees and cost recovery charges, or any programs in which Comcast participates, including, but not limited to, public, educational, and governmental access, universal service, telecom relay services for the visually/hearing impaired, rights-of-way access, and programs supporting the 911/E911 system and any fees or payment obligations imposed by governmental or quasi-governmental bodies for the sale, installation, use, or provision of the Service(s). <strong>YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY GOVERNMENT IMPOSED FEES AND TAXES THAT BECOME APPLICABLE RETROACTIVELY.</strong> We will provide you with notice and an effective date of any change in our prices or fees, unless the change in price is related to a change in governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, fees, or assessments, in which case we may elect not to provide notice except where required by applicable law. Not all fees apply to all Service(s).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For Video Customers.</strong> Video price information is supplied with our Welcome Kit. </li>
    <li><strong>For HSI Customers.</strong> HSI price information is available at <a href="http://www.comcast.com/">www.comcast.com</a> (or an alternative site if we notify you). </li>
    <li><strong>For XV Customers.</strong> XV price information is available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.comcast.com/voice/terms-of-service" target="_blank">www.comcast.com/voice/terms-of-service</a> (or an alternative site if we notify you). </li>
    <li><strong>For Minimum Term Customers.</strong> If you have agreed to a minimum term arrangement, your price for Service(s) is as specified in the minimum term arrangement. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b. How We Will Bill You. </strong>Unless you are subject to a minimum term arrangement, Service(s) are provided to you on a month-to-month basis. You will generally be billed monthly, in advance, for recurring service charges, equipment charges, and fees. <strong>YOU MUST PAY, ON OR BEFORE THE DAY WE INSTALL ANY OR ALL OF THE SERVICE(S), THE FIRST MONTH&rsquo;S SERVICE CHARGES, XFINITY EQUIPMENT CHARGES, ANY DEPOSITS, AND ANY INSTALLATION CHARGES. </strong>Your first bill may include pro-rated charges from the date you first begin receiving Service(s), as well as monthly recurring charges for the next month and charges for non-recurring services you have received. You may be billed for some Service(s) individually after they have been provided to you; these include measured and per-call charges (as explained below) and charges for pay-per-view movies or events, interactive television, and e-commerce. If you receive Service(s) under a promotion, after the promotional period ends, regular charges for the Service(s) will apply.<br />
We do not waive our rights to collect the full balance owed to us by accepting partial payment. We will apply the partial payment to the outstanding charges in the amounts and proportions that we determine.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For XV Customers.</strong> If you pay a flat monthly fee for your calling plan, that fee may not cover certain types of calls. You will be billed for these excluded call types on a per-call basis (e.g., operator services) or a measured basis (e.g., international calls).<br />
    Generally, for billing purposes, a measured call begins when the call is answered by the called party or an automated answering device (such as an answering machine or fax machine); it ends when one of the parties disconnects the call. However, some providers (e.g., those involved in calls to foreign countries) charge for a completed call when the called party&rsquo;s line rings or after a certain number of rings. If such a provider charges Comcast, its affiliates, or suppliers as if your call were answered by the called party, Comcast will charge you for a completed call.<br />
    Measured calls are recorded in whole minutes, with partial minutes rounded up to the next whole minute. If the charge for a measured call or for taxes or surcharges includes a fraction of a cent, the fraction is rounded up to the nearest whole cent.&nbsp; See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.comcast.com/voice/terms-of-service" target="_blank">www.comcast.com/voice/terms-of-service</a> for information on per-call charges and the timing of measured-call charges.<br />
    Our paper bills for XV contain only a summary of charges. Detailed information about your calls and charges are available for a limited period at a password-protected portion of our website. You may call 1-800-COMCAST for a paper copy of outbound toll call records related to your most recent bill. There may be an additional charge for these outbound toll call records except as otherwise required by applicable law. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>c. Third-Party Charges That Are Your Responsibility.</strong> You acknowledge that you may incur charges with third-party service providers such as accessing on-line services, calling parties who charge for their telephone-based services, purchasing or subscribing to other offerings via the Internet or interactive options on your Video Service that are separate and apart from the amounts charged by us. You are solely responsible for all such charges payable to third parties, including all applicable taxes. In addition, you are solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions.</p>
<p><strong>d. Alternative Billing Arrangements. </strong>Comcast may agree to provide billing services on behalf of third parties, as the agent of the third party. Any such third-party charges shall be payable pursuant to any contract or other arrangement between you and the third party. We will not be responsible for any dispute regarding these charges between you and any third party. You must address all such disputes directly with the third party.</p>
<p><strong>e. Payment by Credit Card or Check. </strong>If you use a credit card to pay for the Service(s), use of the card is governed by the card issuer agreement, and you must refer to that agreement for your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. If Comcast does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand. If you make payment by check, you authorize Comcast to collect your check electronically. You agree that you may not amend or modify this Agreement with any restrictive endorsements (such as &ldquo;paid in full&rdquo;), or other statements or releases on or accompanying checks or other payments accepted by Comcast and any such notations shall have no legal effect.</p>
<p><strong>f. Our Remedies if You Pay Late or Fail to Pay.</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Late or Non-Payments:</strong> You may be billed fees, charges, and assessments related to late or non-payments if for any reason (a) Comcast does not receive payment for the Service(s) by the payment due date or (b) you pay less than the full amount due for the Service(s).
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For Maryland Customers. YOU WILL BE ASSESSED A LATE FEE OF 10% PER MONTH FOR ANY PAYMENT AMOUNT THAT HAS NOT BEEN PAID IN FULL AFTER 45 DAYS FROM THE DATE THE INVOICE WAS SENT, EXCEPT IN GARRETT AND ALLEGANY COUNTIES AND HANCOCK, MD. No more than three (3) monthly late fees will be imposed for any single payment amount that is past due, regardless of the period during which the payment remains past due. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>For Garrett and Allegany County, Maryland Customers. </strong>YOU WILL BE ASSESSED A LATE FEE OF $4.95 PER MONTH FOR EACH ACCOUNT THAT HAS NOT BEEN PAID IN FULL AFTER 45 DAYS FROM THE DATE THE INVOICE WAS SENT.</li>
        <li><strong>For Hancock, Maryland Customers.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>YOU WILL BE ASSESSED A LATE FEE OF $2.00 PER MONTH FOR EACH ACCOUNT THAT HAS NOT BEEN PAID IN FULL AFTER 45 DAYS FROM THE DATE THE INVOICE WAS SENT.&nbsp;</strong> </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fees Not Considered Interest or Penalties:</strong> Comcast does not anticipate that you will fail to pay for the Service(s) on a timely basis, and we do not extend credit to customers. Any fees, charges, and assessments due to late payment or nonpayment are liquidated damages intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of our costs resulting from late payments and non-payments. These costs will be difficult to calculate or to predict when we set such fees, charges, and assessments, because we cannot know in advance: (a) whether you will pay for the Service(s) on a timely basis, if ever; (b) if you do pay late, when you will actually pay; and (c) what costs we will incur because of your late payment or non-payment. </li>
    <li><strong>Collection Costs:</strong> If we use a collection agency or attorney to collect money owed by you, you agree to pay the reasonable costs of collection. These costs include, but are not limited to, any collection agency&rsquo;s fees, reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, and arbitration or court costs. </li>
    <li><strong>Suspension/Disconnect: </strong>If you fail to pay the full amount due for any or all of the Service(s) then Comcast, at its sole discretion in accordance with and subject to applicable law, may suspend or disconnect any or all the Service(s) you receive. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>g. Reconnection Fees and Related Charges. </strong>If you resume Service(s) after any suspension, we may require you to pay a reconnection fee. If you reinstate any or all Service(s) after disconnection, we may require you to pay an installation fee and/or service activation fee. These fees are in addition to all past due charges and other fees. Reconnection of the Service(s) is subject to our credit policies, this Agreement and applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>h. Our Right to Make Credit Inquiries. YOU AUTHORIZE COMCAST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CREDIT EXPERIENCE FROM OTHERS, TO ENTER THIS INFORMATION IN YOUR FILE, AND TO DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION CONCERNING YOU TO APPROPRIATE THIRD PARTIES FOR REASONABLE BUSINESS PURPOSES.</strong></p>
<p><strong>i. Your Responsibilities Concerning Billing Questions.</strong> Subject to applicable law, if you intend to dispute a charge or request a billing credit, you must contact Comcast within sixty (60) days of the date on the bill. You waive any disputes or credits that you do not report within sixty (60) days.</p>
</blockquote>
<div dfcmhtmlarea="Top section" dfcmeditable="True">
<ul>
    <li><strong>For Sacramento, California Customers.</strong>If there are any billing errors or other requests for credit, you must bring those to our attention within sixty (60) days of the time you receive the bill for which you are seeking correction, unless applicable law provides for a longer period which cannot be waived or otherwise modified. We will investigate and respond to all complaints within five (5) business days of the receipt of the complaint. In some cases, an investigation might require a search of historical records that could take up to 14 business days. If you believe a payment was made which was not credited to your account, a copy of a cancelled check or money order may be required and the disputed amount will be set aside for up to fourteen (14) days while you gather that documentation. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>3. REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT</strong><br />
We may require you to pay a refundable deposit when you activate the Service(s), if you add Xfinity Equipment and/or Service(s) or if you fail to pay any amounts when they are due. If we disconnect your Service(s) or are otherwise required under applicable law to refund the deposit, we shall within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by applicable law return a sum equal to the deposit(s) you paid (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including without limitation, any amounts owed for the&nbsp;Service(s) or for any Xfinity Equipment that is damaged, altered, or not returned).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For Prince Georges, Maryland Customers.</strong>If we disconnect your Service(s) or are otherwise required under applicable law to refund the deposit, we shall within thirty (30) days or your next billing cycle, whichever is earlier, return a sum equal to the deposit(s) you paid (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including without limitation, any amounts owed for the&nbsp;Service(s) or for any ComcastXfinity Equipment that is damaged, altered, or not returned). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. CHANGES TO SERVICES</strong><br />
Subject to applicable law, we have the right to change our Service(s), Xfinity Equipment and rates or charges, at any time with or without notice. We also may rearrange, delete, add to, or otherwise change programming or features or offerings contained in the Service(s), including, but not limited to, content, functionality, hours of availability, customer equipment requirements, speed, and upstream and downstream rate limitations. If we do give you notice, it may be provided on your monthly bill, as a bill insert, email, in a newspaper or other communication permitted under applicable law. If you find a change in the Service(s) unacceptable, you have the right to cancel your Service(s). However, if you continue to receive Service(s) after the change, this will constitute your acceptance of the change.</p>
<p><strong>5. ACCESS TO YOUR PREMISES AND CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT</strong></p>
<blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
<p><strong>a. Premises.</strong> You agree to allow us and our agents the right to enter your property at which the Service(s) and/or Xfinity Equipment will be provided (the &ldquo;Premises&rdquo;) at reasonable times, for purposes of installing, configuring, maintaining, inspecting, upgrading, replacing and removing the Service(s) and/or Comcast Equipment used to receive any of the Service(s).

<ul>
    <li><strong>For California West Bay Area and San Francisco, California Customers.</strong>If we fail to keep an appointment, we will credit your account with free installation or service call free of charge if the appointment was for an installation or service call for which a fee was to be charged or a minimum credit of $20. </li>
    <li><strong>For Sacramento, California Customers.</strong>If we fail to keep an appointment, we will credit your account with one month of Limited Basic up to a maximum credit equal to one month of the Standard Cable price. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b. Customer Equipment. </strong>Customer Equipment means software, hardware&nbsp;or services that you elect to use in connection with the Service(s) or Xfinity Equipment. You agree to allow us and our agents the rights to insert cable cards and other hardware in the Customer Equipment, send software and/or &ldquo;downloads&rdquo; to the Customer Equipment and install, configure, maintain, inspect and upgrade the Customer Equipment and Xfinity Equipment.

</blockquote>
<p><strong>6. MAINTENANCE AND OWNERSHIP OF EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE</strong></p>
<blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
<p><strong>a. Xfinity Equipment. </strong>You agree that except for the wiring installed inside the Premises (&ldquo;Inside Wiring&rdquo;), or equipment purchased by you from Comcast, all Xfinity Equipment belongs to us or other third parties and will not be deemed fixtures or in any way part of the Premises. Xfinity Equipment means all software or &ldquo;downloads&rdquo; to Customer Equipment or Xfinity Equipment and all new or reconditioned equipment installed, provided or leased to you by us or our agents, including, but not limited to, cabling or wiring and related electronic devices, cable modems, voice capable modems, wireless gateway/routers, CableCARDs, and any other hardware excluding equipment purchased by you from Comcast. You agree to use Xfinity Equipment only for the Service(s) pursuant to this Agreement. We may remove or change the Xfinity Equipment at our discretion at any time the Service(s) are active or following the termination of your Service(s). You agree that our addition or removal of or change to the Xfinity Equipment may interrupt your Service(s). You may not sell, lease, abandon, or give away the Xfinity Equipment, or permit any other provider of video, high speed data or telephone services to use the Xfinity Equipment. The Xfinity Equipment may only be used in the Premises. At your request, we may relocate the Xfinity Equipment in the Premises for an additional charge, at a time agreeable to you and us. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU ATTEMPT TO INSTALL OR USE THE XFINITY EQUIPMENT OR SERVICE(S) AT A LOCATION OTHER THAN THE PREMISES, THE SERVICE(S) MAY FAIL TO FUNCTION OR MAY FUNCTION IMPROPERLY. You agree that you will not allow anyone other than Comcast or its agents to service the Xfinity Equipment. We suggest that the Xfinity Equipment in your possession be covered by your homeowners, renters, or other insurance. You will be directly responsible for loss, repair, replacement and other costs, damages, fees and charges if you do not return the Xfinity Equipment to us in an undamaged condition.</p>
<p><strong>b. Customer Equipment.</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Comcast has no responsibility for the operation or support, maintenance, or repair of any Customer Equipment including, but not limited to, Customer Equipment to which Comcast or a third party has sent software or &ldquo;downloads.&rdquo;
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For Video, HSI, and XV Customers.</strong> You agree by using the Service(s), you are enabling and authorizing Comcast, its authorized agents and equipment manufacturers to send code updates to the Xfinity Equipment and Customer Equipment, including, but not limited to, cable modems, digital interactive televisions with CableCARDs, and&nbsp;voice capable modems&nbsp;at any time it is determined necessary to do so as part of the Service(s). Such code updates may change, add or remove features or functionality of any such equipment or the Service(s). </li>
        <li><strong>For HSI and XV Customers. </strong>You can find Comcast&rsquo;s current minimum technical and other requirements for HSI customers at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.comcast.com/Support/Corp1/FAQ/FaqDetail2205.html" target="_blank">http://www.comcast.com/Support/Corp1/FAQ/FaqDetail2205.html</a> and for XV customers at <a href="http://customer.comcast.com/help-and-support/phone" target="_blank">http://customer.comcast.com/help-and-support/phone</a>. These requirements may be located at an alternative site if we so notify you. To use XV, you will need a voice capable modem that meets our specifications. In some areas, we may permit you to use XV with a&nbsp;voice capable modem that you have purchased. Depending on availability in your area, you may have an option to install the voice capable modem yourself or to have Comcast install it for you. You agree to keep the voice capable modem plugged into a working electrical power outlet at all times. Whether a cable modem, gateway/router, voice capable modem or other device is owned by you or us, we have the unrestricted right, but not the obligation, to upgrade or change the firmware in these devices remotely or on the Premises at any time that we determine it necessary or desirable in order to provide Service(s) to you in accordance with our specifications and requirements. </li>
        <li><strong>For XV Customers. </strong>You acknowledge and understand XV may not support or be compatible with non-recommended configurations including, but not limited to, voice capable modems not currently certified by Comcast as compatible with XV; Customer Equipment, including, but not limited to, non-voice communications equipment, including certain makes or models of alarm and security systems or devices, certain medical monitoring, personal emergency alert, and home detention devices, certain fax machines, and certain &ldquo;dial-up&rdquo; modems; rotary-dial phone handsets, pulse-dial phone handsets, and models of other voice-related communications equipment such as private branch exchange (PBX) equipment, answering machines, and traditional Caller ID units. In order to use XV, you are required to provide certain equipment such as a phone handset or equivalent, inside phone wiring and outlets, and an electrical power outlet. CERTAIN MAKES AND MODELS OF CORDLESS PHONES USE THE ELECTRICAL POWER IN YOUR HOME. IF THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL POWER OUTAGE, THE CORDLESS PHONE WILL CEASE TO OPERATE DURING THE OUTAGE, PREVENTING USE OF XV VIA THE CORDLESS PHONE. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CONNECT CDV TO INSIDE PHONE WIRING YOURSELF. In order to use online features of XV, where we make those features available, you are required to provide certain hardware, such as a personal computer, software, an Internet browser, and access to the Internet. </li>
        <li><strong>For Unlimited Select Customers.</strong> You acknowledge and understand Unlimited Select will not support or be compatible with: non-recommended configurations including, but not limited to, voice-capable modems not currently certified by Comcast as compatible with Unlimited Select; Customer Equipment, including, but not limited to, non-voice communications equipment, including certain alarm and security systems or devices, medical monitoring devices, personal emergency alert, and home detention devices, certain fax machines, and certain &ldquo;dial-up&rdquo; modems; rotary-dial phone handsets, pulse-dial phone handsets, and models of other voice-related communications equipment such as private branch exchange (PBX) equipment, answering machines, and traditional Caller ID units.

In order to use online features of Unlimited Select, where we make those features available, you are required to provide certain hardware, such as a personal computer, software, an Internet browser, and access to the Internet. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Non-Recommended Configurations:</strong> Customer Equipment that does not meet Comcast&rsquo;s minimum technical or other specifications constitutes a &ldquo;Non-Recommended Configuration.&rdquo; NEITHER COMCAST NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR AGENTS WARRANT THAT A NON-RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION WILL ENABLE YOU TO SUCCESSFULLY INSTALL, ACCESS, OPERATE, OR USE THE SERVICE(S). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY SUCH INSTALLATION, ACCESS, OPERATION, OR USE COULD CAUSE CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT TO FAIL TO OPERATE OR CAUSE DAMAGE TO CUSTOMER EQUIPMENT, YOU, YOUR PREMISES OR XFINITY EQUIPMENT. NEITHER COMCAST NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR AGENTS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY SUCH FAILURE OR DAMAGE. Comcast reserves the right to deny you customer support for the Service(s) and/or terminate Service(s) if you use a Non-Recommended Configuration. </li>
    <li><strong>No Unauthorized Devices or Tampering: </strong>You agree not to attach or assist any person to attach, any unauthorized device to our cable network, Xfinity Equipment or the Service(s). If you make or assist any person to make any unauthorized connection or modification to Xfinity Equipment or the Service(s) or any other part of our cable network, we may terminate your Service(s) and recover such damages as may result from your actions.<br />
    You also agree that you will not attach anything to the Inside Wiring, Xfinity Equipment, or Customer Equipment, whether installed by you or us, which singly or together impairs the integrity of our cable network or degrades our cable network&rsquo;s signal quality or strength or creates signal leakage.<br />
    You also agree that we may recover damages from you for tampering with any Xfinity Equipment or any other part of our cable network or for receiving unauthorized Service(s). You agree that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to calculate precisely the lost revenue resulting from your receipt of unauthorized Service(s) or the tampering with Xfinity Equipment or our cable network. You therefore agree to pay us as liquidated damages, the sum of $500.00 per device used to receive the unauthorized Service(s) in addition to our cost to replace any altered, damaged, or unreturned Xfinity Equipment or other equipment owned by Comcast, including any incidental costs. The unauthorized reception of the Service(s) may also result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment. </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For XV Customers.</strong> You will be liable for all authorized and unauthorized XV use at the Premises. You agree to notify us immediately in writing or by calling 1-800-XFINITY during normal business hours if your voice capable modem has been stolen or your Service(s) are being stolen or used without your authorization. When you call or write, you must provide your account number and a detailed description of the circumstances of the theft of your voice capable modem or unauthorized XV use. If you fail to notify us in a timely manner, your Service(s) may be terminated without notice and you may incur additional charges. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>c. Inside Wiring.</strong> You may install Inside Wiring, such as additional cable wiring and outlets, provided it does not interfere with the normal operations of our cable network. If you have us install Inside Wiring, we will charge you for that service. Regardless of who installed it, we consider the Inside Wiring your property or the property of whomever owns the Premises. Accordingly, you are responsible for the repair and maintenance of the Inside Wiring, unless you and Comcast have agreed otherwise in writing. (If you do not own the Premises, contact your landlord or building manager about the repair or maintenance of Inside Wiring.) If you have us repair or maintain the Inside Wiring, we will charge you for that service.</p>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For Sacramento, California Customers.</strong>Comcast will be responsible to repair any defects of the Inside Wiring installed by Comcast for thirty (30) days after new residential&nbsp;video installations. </li>
        <li><strong>For XV Customers.</strong> Except as described below, you may use XV with your telephone Inside Wiring, as long as we have reasonable access to it and you have the right to give us access to it. If you wish to have your voice capable modem connected to your telephone Inside Wiring, you are advised to have a Comcast technician perform the installation. To make that connection, we must first disconnect your telephone Inside Wiring from the network of your existing telephone provider, which may disable any services you receive from them. If you install XV yourself (where self-installation is an option), you should connect the voice capable modem to a cordless phone, not directly to your telephone Inside Wiring. If the voice capable modem is connected to your telephone Inside Wiring without first disconnecting the wiring from any existing telephone provider&rsquo;s network, the voice capable modem may be damaged and/or XV may not operate properly. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>d. End User Software Licenses.</strong> You agree to comply with the terms and conditions of all end user license agreements accompanying any software or plug-ins to such software distributed or used in connection with the Services including, without limitation, the Comcast Software License Agreement, <a href="http://www.comcast.com/termsofservice/agreement.html" target="_blank">www.comcast.com/termsofservice/agreement.html</a>, as these agreemnets may be amended from time to time. All such agreeements are incorporated in this Agreement by reference. When this Agreement terminates, all end user licenses also terminate; you agree to destroy at that time all versions and copies of all software received by you in connection with the Services.</p>

You agree that the Service(s) and the Xfinity Equipment will be used only for personal, residential, non-commercial purposes, unless otherwise specifically authorized by us in writing. You will not use the Xfinity Equipment at any time at an address other than the Premises without our prior written authorization. You agree and represent that you will not resell or permit another to resell the Service(s) in whole or in part. You will not use or permit another to use the Xfinity Equipment or the Service(s), directly or indirectly, for any unlawful purpose, including, but not limited to, in violation of any posted Comcast policy applicable to the Service(s).

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Comcast and its affiliates, suppliers, and agents against all claims and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising out of the use of the Service(s), the Xfinity Equipment and/or the Customer Equipment or the breach of this Agreement or any of the applicable Comcast policies by you or any other user of the Service(s) at the Premises.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>13. BINDING ARBITRATION</strong></p>
<blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>a. Purpose.</strong> If you have a Dispute (as defined below) with Comcast that cannot be resolved through an informal dispute resolution with Comcast, you or Comcast may elect to arbitrate that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Provision rather than litigate the Dispute in court. Arbitration means you will have a fair hearing before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury. Proceeding in arbitration may result in limited discovery and may be subject to limited review by courts.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>b. Definitions.</strong> The term &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Comcast regarding any aspect of your relationship with Comcast, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Provision. &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. As used in this Arbitration Provision, &ldquo;Comcast&rdquo; means Comcast and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>c. Right to Opt Out.</strong> IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU MUST NOTIFY COMCAST IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST RECEIVE THIS AGREEMENT BY VISITING <a href="http://www.COMCAST.COM/ARBITRATIONOPTOUT" target="_blank">WWW.COMCAST.COM/ARBITRATIONOPTOUT</a>, OR BY MAIL TO COMCAST 1701 JOHN F. KENNEDY BLVD., PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2838, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO COMCAST MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME, ADDRESS AND COMCAST ACCOUNT NUMBER AS WELL AS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH COMCAST THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COMCAST OR THE DELIVERY OF SERVICE(S) TO YOU BY COMCAST. IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED COMCAST OF YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>d. Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.</strong> If you or Comcast elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with the American Arbitration Association - Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, SUite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043, 877-493-4185,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association "AAA".</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>e. Arbitration Procedures.</strong> Because the Service(s) provided to you by Comcast concerns interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;), not state arbitration law, shall govern the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, applicable federal law or the law of the state where you receive the service from Comcast may apply to and govern the substance of any Disputes. No state statutes pertaining to arbitration shall be applicable under this Arbitration Provision.<br />
If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rules of the arbitration organization, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If AAA will not enforce this Arbitration Provision as written, it cannot serve as the arbitration organization to resolve your dispute with Comcast. If this situation arises, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties are unable to agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will enforce this Arbitration Provision as written. If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of this Agreement, this Arbitration Provision shall govern.<br />
A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information.<br />
The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. An award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.<br />
If an award granted by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the same arbitration organization by a written notice of appeal filed within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the arbitration organization. The arbitration organization will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party&rsquo;s notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA.</p>

Limitations.</strong> XV includes 911/Enhanced 911 functionality (&ldquo;911/E911&rdquo;) that may differ from the 911/E911 functionality furnished by other providers.

<p style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><strong>i. Correct Address:</strong> In order for your 911/E911 calls to be properly directed to emergency services, Comcast must have your correct Premises address. If you move XV to a different address without Comcast&rsquo;s approval, 911/E911 calls may be directed to the wrong emergency authority, may transmit the wrong address, and/or XV (including 911/E911) may fail altogether. Therefore, you must call 1-800-XFINITY before you move XV to a new address. Comcast will need several business days to update your Premises address in the E911 system so that your 911/E911 calls can be properly directed. All changes in service address require Comcast&rsquo;s prior approval.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><strong>ii. Service Interruptions: </strong>XV uses the electrical power in your home. If there is an electrical power outage, 911 calling may be interrupted if a battery backup in the associated voice capable modem is not installed, fails, or is exhausted after several hours. Furthermore, calls, including calls to 911/E911, may not be completed if there is a problem with network facilities, including network congestion, network/equipment/power failure, or another technical problem.</p>

Suspension and Termination by Comcast: </strong>You understand and acknowledge that all XV, including 911/E911, as well as all online features of XV, where we make these features available, will be disabled if your account is suspended or terminated.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><strong>iv. Telephone Number Assignments:</strong>&nbsp; The telephone numbers utilized for XV are assigned in accordance with applicable federal and state numbering rules.&nbsp;Therefore, XV cannot accommodate the assignment of a telephone number outside of the telephone rate center to which that number is appropriately assigned</p>

<p style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><strong>b.

This is the best way for us to arrange for your service to be disconnected and to schedule an installation at your new home if your new home is in our  service area.<BR><BR><strong>EQUIPMENT<BR></strong>In the event your service is terminated, the converter, remote control and any other equipment provided by us  should be returned to our local business office. You will continue to be billed for the equipment until it is returned. If you have lost or are otherwise unable to return the equipment you will  be billed for the equipment.<BR><BR><strong>IDENTIFICATION<BR></strong>Our employees and designated contractors are required to carry a photo-identification card  while working. Feel free to ask for identification from anyone who claims to be our employee or representative.<BR><BR><strong>PREVIEWS<BR></strong>During the  course of the year, we may offer a &ldquo;Free Preview&rdquo; of a premium channel. If you find any of the programming objectionable, you may call us, and we will block out the Free Preview  channel.<BR><BR><strong>EQUIPMENT COMPATIBILITY<BR>TELEVISIONS AND VCR COMPATIBILITY<BR></strong>Many newer television sets and videocassette  recorders (VCRs) are labeled &ldquo;cable ready.&rdquo; Typically, a cable-ready television or VCR is one which, when connected directly to cable service, can receive all unscrambled,  non-premium channels (premium channels include such channels as HBO and Showtime). Older televisions and VCRs are more likely to be non-cable ready, which means they  generally receive only some numbered channels (usually channels 2-13). Even if you have an older television or VCR that was advertised as being &ldquo;cable ready&rdquo; or &ldquo;cable compatible,&rdquo;  the equipment may not perform as you expected when connected directly to our cable system. This is because there previously were no standards applicable to television set  manufactures governing the reception of cable channels. According to new federal regulations, televisions and VCRs sold in the United States as of July 1997 cannot be called &ldquo;cable  ready&rdquo; or &ldquo;cable compatible&rdquo; unless they comply with the new technical requirements adopted by the FCC, including the ability to properly tune cable channels. Existing equipment may  meet some but not all of these standards, and connecting our cable service directly to such equipment may cause signal degradation or interference. If you are not sure whether your  television or VCR is &ldquo;cable ready&rdquo;, you should review the equipment manual and instructions, or contact the manufacturer. If your equipment is not fully cable ready, you can still receive  all standard cable channels offering non-scrambled or non-encrypted programming by renting or purchasing a single set-top converter without descrambling or decryption capabilities.  For a low monthly fee, we rent set-top converters to our customers that will be compatible with the services you purchase from us. You may also purchase set-top converters at  electronic stores or other retail outlets in your area.<BR><BR><strong>COMPATIBILITY OF SET-TOP CONVERTERS AND CABLECARDS<BR></strong>Many subscribers  currently rent or own set-top converters to receive our cable services. Because a set-top converter functions as the channel tuner on your television or VCR, it may prevent you from  using some of the special features and functions of your television or VCR. For example, you may not be able to view one program while recording another, record two or more  consecutive programs that appear on different channels, use advanced picture generation and display features such as &ldquo;picture in picture,&rdquo; channel review or use other features that  necessitate channel selection by the television set or VCR. Some of these problems may be resolved by the use of A/B switches, signal splitters, and/or other supplemental equipment  that can be purchased from Comcast or at electronic stores. Please call us if you would like to discuss the type of special equipment needed to resolve individual compatibility  problems or if you have any questions regarding other equipment compatibility issues.<BR><BR>In order to enable you to utilize special features, which your television and VCR may  have, we will make available, upon your request, equipment which will allow for simultaneous reception of two or more scrambled or encrypted signals and for tuning to alternative  channels on a pre-programmed schedule. This equipment could include for example, set-top converters and multiple descrambler/decoders and/or timers (or if such devices are not  available, multiple set-top devices will be provided), and signal bypass switches. <BR>If you plan to purchase cable services that we scramble or encrypt, such as premium,  pay-per-view or digital services, you should make sure that any set-top converter, or navigation device or digital-cable-ready television (which can receive digital cable services using  a device that we must provide called a CableCARD in place of a converter) that you purchase from a retail outlet is compatible with our system. Due to device limitations, digital  cable-ready retail devices using CableCARD technology only receive what is known as &ldquo;one-way&rdquo; cable services. Such devices cannot receive &ldquo;two-way&rdquo; cable services, such as  Comcast&rsquo;s electronic program guide, video-on-demand, or switched digital video services. Customers with a TiVo digital cable-ready DVR can access switched digital video  services by obtaining a &ldquo;tuning adapter&rdquo; device from Comcast. Customers with the TiVo DVR or other digital cable-ready devices will need a digital set-top box from Comcast to  access switched digital video and other two-way cable services. Two-way digital cable-ready devices are not yet commercially available, but are expected to be available in the near  future. Upon your request, we will provide you with the necessary technical parameters necessary for any set-top converter rented or acquired from retail outlets to operate with our  cable system. If you see advertisements for set-top converters that have descramblers in them, you should understand that these devices may be illegal to use. Because of the need to  protect our scrambled services, we will not authorize the use of any converter/descrambler that does not conform to all required signal security specifications. People who use illegal  converters/descramblers may be subject to prosecution for theft of cable service. It is unlawful to alter or tamper with any device belonging to a cable operator in order to receive,  intercept, or assist in receiving or intercepting any communications service offered over a cable system. People who take such actions may be subject to fines or imprisonment.  <BR><BR><strong>REMOTE CONTROL UNITS<BR></strong>We rent remote control units to subscribers to access set-top converter features remotely. Currently, we provide  subscribers with set-top converters with compatible remote control units. Although we rent remote control units at a nominal fee, subscribers may purchase compatible remotes at  local electronic stores or other retail outlets. A representative list of compatible remote control models currently available from local retailers includes: Philips PHL PMDVR8, RCA  RCR612, and Sony RM-V202. A list of additional compatible remotes may be obtained from your local Comcast office. Although these remote control units are compatible with the  set-top converters that we currently offer, these remotes may not be functional if we change the type of set-top converters we offer to subscribers. If you have any questions regarding  whether a particular remote control unit would be compatible with our equipment, please contact us.<BR><BR><strong>NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY OF CONVERTERS FOR  ADDITIONAL OUTLETS<BR></strong>Subscribers who install their own additional receiver connections may not be able to receive all broadcast stations carried on the cable  system without additional equipment. For those television sets that are not truly compatible with the cable system, television broadcast stations located above Channel 13 may not be  receivable without additional equipment.<BR><BR>The equipment necessary to receive all broadcast stations carried on the cable system is for lease and/or sale from your cable  company and may be available from retail stores within your community. Instructions for installation of this equipment are also available upon request. Please contact your local cable  company for complete details.<BR><BR><strong>SERVICE CHANGES AND INSTALLATION<BR></strong>Standard installations are generally completed within 7 business  days. If you initiate a change in the services you receive, you may be subject to the applicable installation or change of service charge. Please refer to the service rate information we  have supplied to you for details. A list of our services and charges is provided to our customers annually in a mailing or bill insert. You may obtain additional information about our  current services, fees and prices by calling us during normal business hours.<BR><BR><strong>OTHER SERVICES AND INFORMATION<BR></strong>In addition to our  Basic and Preferred Service packages, we also offer optional video and audio programming services, including individual premium channels (such as HBO, Cinemax, Showtime,  Starz and Encore) and pay-per-view services which deliver individual movies, sporting events and special events. We also offer Digital Service packages and High Speed Cable  Modem Service in selected service areas where our cable plant has been rebuilt or upgraded. For some optional services you must have a compatible addressable converter or a  cable modem. <BR><BR>Please call us at the local customer service number listed on the How To Reach Us insert to talk to one of our customer service representatives about our  products and services, or go to our website, <A href="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/" originalAttribute="href" originalPath="http://www.comcast.com/">www.comcast.com</A> to see the latest information on our services. <BR><BR>We may change this  information in the future.
