	<h4>Residential Services Agreement</h4>
	Effective 10/07/2011
	<br /><br />
	<strong>TERMS OF SERVICE APPLICABLE TO SERVICE(S):</strong>
	<br />
	You ("You" or "Customer') understand and agree that Sections 1 through 26 of  this Residential Service Agreement ("Agreement") apply to Suddenlink  Communications' ("Suddenlink") provision of each and every service  ("Service(s)") ordered by Customer or provided by Suddenlink as part of a  Service, which may include cable television service ("Video Service"), high  speed data service ("High Speed Internet Service"), voice service ("Phone  Service") and any equipment rented from or otherwise supplied by or on behalf  of Suddenlink to you (&quot;Equipment&quot;). For purposes of clarity,  &quot;Services&quot; as defined herein excludes any services or equipment  provided by Suddenlink Security, which are covered by separate agreement.
	<ol start="1" type="1" class="ol-style">
		<li><strong><u>Agreement</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Customer agrees to be bound to this Agreement by: (i) executing a copy of the service order presented to Customer at the time of installation ("Service Order"), (ii) ordering a Service, or (iii) using one or more Services at Customer's location. Suddenlink may, in its sole discretion, change, modify, add or remove portions of this Agreement at any time by posting the amended Agreement on the Company website at www.suddenlink.com, or by giving Customer notice in accordance with Section 22 of this Agreement.&nbsp; Customer's continued use of the Services following such notice shall be deemed as Customer's acceptance to any revision in this Agreement.&nbsp; If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, Customer must immediately notify Suddenlink of Customer's intent to terminate Service and return all Equipment. </li>
		<li><strong><u>Residential Use</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; The Services provided are solely for Customer's personal, residential use and Customer shall not use Services for any commercial purpose.&nbsp; Suddenlink shall have the right to determine, in its sole discretion, what constitutes a "commercial" purpose. </li>
		<li><strong><u>Access to Customer Premises</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Customer grants Suddenlink and its employees, representatives and/or agents the right to enter Customer's premises and access Equipment, the wiring within Customer's premises and Customer's computer(s) to install, connect, inspect, maintain, repair, replace, disconnect, remove or alter the Equipment, check for signal leakage, or install or deliver Suddenlink provided software ("Software").&nbsp; Customer shall cooperate in providing such access upon request of Suddenlink.&nbsp; If Customer is not the owner of the premises, Customer warrants that Customer has obtained the legal authority of the owner to authorize Suddenlink personnel and/or its agents to enter the premises for the purposes described herein. </li>
		<li><strong><u>Payment</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; The charges for one month of Services, including any deposits and installation and Equipment charges, are due upon installation of the Services.&nbsp; Thereafter, Customer agrees to pay monthly recurring Service charges and Equipment charges (if any) in advance, including all applicable fees, taxes, regulatory fees, franchise fees, surcharges (including a <a href="http://suddenlinkfyi.com/misc-topics/broadcast-surcharge/">broadcast station surcharge</a>) and other government assessments no later than the date indicated on Customer's bill.&nbsp; Charges for non-recurring Services or Equipment charges will be reflected on Customer's subsequent bill at the then current applicable rates. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>If Customer elects to pay by automatic recurring credit card, debit card or automatic clearing house payments, Customer authorizes Suddenlink to charge such accounts.&nbsp; Failure to receive a bill does not release Customer from Customer's obligation to pay.&nbsp; Failure to pay the total balance when due shall constitute a breach of this Agreement and may be grounds for termination of Service, removal of Equipment from Customer's premises and/or imposition of an administrative fee ("Administrative Fee") in accordance with applicable law.&nbsp; Any Administrative Fee imposed on Customer is intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of costs of managing past due accounts.&nbsp; Suddenlink does not extend credit to Suddenlink's Customers and the Administrative Fee is not interest, a credit service charge or a finance charge. </li>
		<li><strong><u>Additional Fees</u></strong><strong>. </strong>&nbsp;In addition to Customer's monthly recurring charges and any Administrative Fee, additional fees may be imposed, including fees for returned checks, charge card chargeback, early termination, reconnection and service calls.&nbsp; Additional charges may also be imposed if collection activities are required to recover past due balances, including attorney fees.&nbsp; A list of applicable fees is available from your local Suddenlink's office ("Schedule of Fees").&nbsp; Suddenlink reserves the right to amend or change the Schedule of Fees from time to time. </li>
		<li><strong><u>Early Termination Fees</u></strong><strong>. </strong>&nbsp;If you cancel, terminate or downgrade the Service before the completion of any promotional term to which You agreed ("Initial Term"), you agree to pay Suddenlink an early cancellation fee of up to two hundred ($200.00) plus all outstanding charges for all Services used and Equipment purchased for which you have not paid us prior to termination.&nbsp; You agree that early cancellation fees or any other fees may automatically be charged to your account and your credit or debit card provided to Suddenlink Communications and you agree to pay such fees. </li>
		<li><strong><u>Security Deposits</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Customer acknowledges and agrees that Suddenlink may (a) verify Customer's credit standing with credit reporting agencies; (b) furnish information about you (including your social security number), your account(s) and your payment history to those credit reporting agencies; and (c) require a deposit based on Customer's credit standing or past payment history with Suddenlink.&nbsp; A deposit does not relieve the Customer of the responsibility for the prompt payment of bills on presentation.&nbsp; Security deposits paid by Customer for Equipment or Services may be used, to the extent permitted by law, to offset any unpaid balance or charges after termination of Service.&nbsp; Customer shall remain liable for any outstanding balances after the security deposit has been applied.&nbsp; Further terms and conditions of the security deposit may be contained in the deposit receipt given to Customer at the time the security deposit is collected. </li>
		<li><strong><u>Disputed Charges</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;       Customer must notify Suddenlink in writing of billing errors disputes or       requests for credit within thirty (30) days after Customer receives the       bill for which correction of an error or credit is sought.&nbsp; The date       of the dispute shall be the date Suddenlink receives sufficient       documentation to enable Suddenlink to investigate the dispute.&nbsp; The       date of the resolution is the date Suddenlink completes its investigation       and notifies the Customer of the disposition of the dispute. </li>
		<li><strong><u>Adjustments or Refunds</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Any adjustment or refund shall be an amount equal to the pro-rata part of the monthly charges applicable to the interrupted Service and associated Equipment charges for the period of time during which the Service is interrupted.&nbsp; The adjustment or refund will be accomplished by a credit on a subsequent bill for Service.&nbsp; Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the liability of Suddenlink, its officers, shareholders, directors, employees, affiliates, vendors, carrier partners, content providers and other persons or entities involved in providing the Services or Equipment (collectively, the "Suddenlink Parties") for damages shall in no event, by reason of any delays, interruptions, omissions, errors, failures or defects in installation or service, exceed an amount equal to the Customer's Service charges and associated Equipment fees for a regular billing period&nbsp; ("Maximum Credit").&nbsp; No credit allowance will be made for: </li>
			<ol start="1" type="1">
				<li>interruptions of Service due to the negligence of or noncompliance with the provisions of the Agreement by Customer or any person authorized by customer to use the Service; </li>	
				<li>interruptions of Service due to the negligence of any person other than Suddenlink including, but not limited to, the other common carriers connected to the Suddenlink's facilities; </li>
				<li>interruptions of Service due to the failure or malfunction of Customer owned equipment or third party equipment; </li>
				<li>interruptions of Service during any period in which Suddenlink is not given full and free access to its facilities and Equipment for the purpose of investigating and correcting interruptions, </li>
				<li>interruptions of Service during a period in which Customer continues to use the Service on an impaired basis; </li>
				<li>interruptions during any period when the interruption is due to implementation of a Customer order for a change in Service arrangements; </li>
				<li>interruptions of Service due to circumstances or causes beyond the control of Suddenlink. </li>
				<li><u>Limitation of Refund</u>.&nbsp; Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, in the event any amounts owed by Suddenlink to Customer are not claimed by Customer within one year of the date on which the amount became payable to Customer, Customer shall forfeit all rights to the refund and all such amounts shall become the property of Suddenlink.&nbsp; </li>
			</ol>
			<li><strong><u>Equipment And Software</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Any network facilities, Software, cabling or Equipment installed or provided by Suddenlink will remain the property of Suddenlink.&nbsp; Customer will acquire no ownership or other interest in the network facilities, cabling, Software or Equipment by virtue of payments made pursuant to this Agreement or by the attachment of any portion of the network facilities, cabling or Equipment to Customer's residence or premises.</li>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
					<li><u>Misuse of Equipment</u>.&nbsp; Customer will not        open, alter, misuse, or tamper with the Equipment. Customer will not remove Equipment from the location where Equipment was installed.&nbsp; Customer will not remove any markings or labels from the Equipment.&nbsp; Customer agrees to safeguard the Equipment from loss or damage of any kind, and (except for any self installation procedures approved by Suddenlink) will not permit anyone other than a Suddenlink authorized representative to perform any work on the Equipment. </li>
					<li><u>Return of Equipment</u>.&nbsp; If Customer's Service is terminated or cancelled (for whatever reason), Customer agrees that Customer no longer has the right to keep or use the Equipment and Customer must promptly return the Equipment.&nbsp; The Equipment must be returned to Suddenlink in the same condition as when received, ordinary wear and tear excepted. If Customer fails to return the Equipment, Customer will pay any expenses Suddenlink incurs in retrieving the Equipment.&nbsp; Failure of Suddenlink to remove the Equipment does not mean that Suddenlink has abandoned the Equipment.&nbsp; Suddenlink may continue to charge Customer a monthly Service fee until any remaining Equipment is returned, collected by Suddenlink or fully paid for by Customer. </li>
					<li><u>Damaged or Lost Equipment</u>.&nbsp; If the Equipment is damaged by Customer, destroyed, lost or stolen while in Customer's possession, Customer is responsible for the cost of repair or replacement of the Equipment. </li>
					<li><u>Operation of Equipment</u>.&nbsp; The Customer agrees        to operate any Equipment in accordance with instructions of Suddenlink or Suddenlink's agent.&nbsp; Failure to do so will relieve the Suddenlink Parties of liability for interruption of Service and may make the Customer responsible for damage to Equipment. </li>
					<li><u>Tests and Inspections</u>.&nbsp; Upon reasonable notification to the Customer, and at a reasonable time, Suddenlink may make such tests and inspections as may be necessary to determine that the Customer is complying with the requirements set forth herein. </li>
					<li><u>Software</u>.&nbsp; Customer agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of any Software license agreement provided with the Software.&nbsp; The Software shall be used solely in connection with the Services and Customer will not modify, disassemble, translate or reverse engineer, the Software.&nbsp; If Customer's Service is terminated, Customer will promptly return or destroy all Software provided by Suddenlink and any related written materials.&nbsp; Suddenlink will have the right to upgrade, modify and enhance the Equipment and Software from        time to time through "uploads." </li>
					<li><u>Repair</u>.&nbsp; Suddenlink will repair and/or replace defective Software or Equipment provided such damage was not caused by misuse, neglect or other fault of Customer.&nbsp; Suddenlink is not responsible for the operation, maintenance, service or repair of any Customer's equipment, including, but not limited to, televisions, computer devices, remote controls or other consumer electronics, including any hardware or third party software, which may be connected to the Services ("Customer Equipment"). </li>
				</ol>
			<li><strong><u>Prohibitions/Theft of Service.</u></strong>&nbsp; Customer shall not intercept, receive or assist in the interception or receipt of, resell, distribute or duplicate any Services.&nbsp;&nbsp; In no event shall Customer use the Services and/or Equipment to engage in any illegal or prohibited activity. </li>
			<li><strong><u>Customer Liability for Users</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Customer must be at least eighteen years of age to subscribe to Services.&nbsp; Customer is responsible for any access, use or misuse of the Services and/or Equipment that may result from access or use by any other person who has access to Customer's premises, equipment or account.&nbsp; Customer is responsible for ensuring that all persons who use Customer's subscribed to Services ("Users") understand and comply with all terms and conditions applicable to the Services. </li>
			<li><strong><u>Privacy Policy</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Customer's privacy interests, including Customer's ability to limit disclosure of certain information to third parties, are addressed by, among other laws, the Communications Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.&nbsp; Customer acknowledges receipt of Suddenlink's privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") governing the collection, use and disclosure of Customer personally identifiable information.&nbsp; The Privacy Policy may also be found on Suddenlink's website ( <a href="http://www.suddenlink.com/">www.suddenlink.com</a> ). </li>
			<li><strong><u>Termination</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Suddenlink may terminate this Agreement immediately at any time, without prior notice, if Customer or a User fails to fully comply with the terms of this Agreement, its components and Suddenlink's Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") or for any other reason or no reason.&nbsp; If Suddenlink terminates Service due to a violation of this Agreement or Suddenlink's policies, Customer may be subject to additional fees and charges, including disconnect and termination fees and Suddenlink may also exercise other rights and remedies available under law. </li>
			<li><strong><u>Customer Obligations Upon Termination</u></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Customer agrees that upon termination of any Service, Customer will immediately cease use of the Equipment and any Software, and; Customer will pay in full the charges for Customer's use of the Service and the Equipment through the later of: (i) the effective date of termination of the Service, (ii) if applicable, the expiration of any promotional term, or (iii) the date when the associated Equipment or Software has been returned to Suddenlink. </li>

	<strong>TERMS OF SERVICE APPLICABLE ONLY TO THE PROVISION OF SUDDENLINK PHONE  SERVICES.</strong>&nbsp; In addition to all other relevant terms  provided in this Agreement, a Customer who subscribes to Suddenlink's Phone  Service understands and agrees to the following: 
	<ol start="57" type="1" class="ol-style">
		<li><strong><u>Limitations of Phone Service</u></strong><strong>. </strong> </li>
			<ol start="1" type="1">
				<li><u>Power/Network Outages.&nbsp; </u>Customer acknowledges and understands that the Phone Service will not work if any of the necessary Equipment is unplugged or otherwise disconnected from necessary power sources.&nbsp; Customer further acknowledges and understands that the Phone Service may not function in the event of power failure or if Customer's broadband cable connection is disrupted or not working properly.&nbsp; Should there be an interruption to the power supply to Customer's home, the Phone Service may be powered by backup battery supply, but the inclusion of a battery backup does not ensure that the Phone Service will work in all circumstances.&nbsp; In the event that there is a loss of power or other problem that disrupts Suddenlink's network, Phone Service will not be available until the network is restored.&nbsp; Cordless telephones powered by electricity will not function during a power outage, even if the Phone Service is functioning properly.&nbsp; CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND UNDERSTANDS THAT SUDDENLINK DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT E911 OR 911 DIALING WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE EVENT OF A POWER FAILURE OR FAILURE OF THE SUDDENLINK NETWORK. </li>
				<li><u>Enhanced 911 Service</u>.&nbsp; Enhanced 911 ("E911"), or 911 service is a feature of the Phone Service.&nbsp; Prior to initiation of Phone Service, Customer must provide Suddenlink the valid street address where the Phone Service will be utilized ("Registered Address").&nbsp; Customer agrees not to move the telephone cable modem ("EMTA") from the location it was originally installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; IF CUSTOMER MOVES THE EMTA FROM THE REGISTERED ADDRESS, CUSTOMER'S PHONE SERVICE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY AND E911/911 OPERATORS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CORRECT LOCATION OF A CALLER IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. </li>
				<li><u>Customer May Not "Opt-out" of Suddenlink's E911 Service</u>.&nbsp; Customer acknowledges that pursuant to federal law the provision of E911 or 911 service to Customer is provided as an express condition of Service by Suddenlink. As a result E911 or 911 service is not an optional feature and customer may not "opt-out," or decline to accept, Suddenlink's E911 or 911 service. </li>
				<li><u>Resetting Equipment after a Power Failure</u>. A power failure or disruption in Service may require Customer to reset or reconfigure equipment prior to utilizing the Phone Service or E911 or 911 dialing.  A power failure may also include a battery failure in the EMTA.  If Customer experiences a battery failure in the EMTA, Suddenlink will provide a replacement battery and installation instructions.</li>
				<li><u>Use of TDD or TTY Devices</u>.&nbsp; Customer        acknowledges that E911/911 service may not be fully compatible with all types of TDD or TTY devices for the hearing impaired. Suddenlink does not guarantee or offer emergency services compatible with any TDD/TTY or other hearing impaired devices. </li>
				<li><u>Home Security Systems and other Non-voice Communications Equipment</u>.&nbsp; Customer acknowledges that the Phone Service may not be compatible with certain third party home security, medical monitoring and other non-voice communications systems.&nbsp; It is the Customer's responsibility to test Customer's home security, medical monitoring system or other non-voice communications system.&nbsp; Customer acknowledges that these systems may not function properly in the event of a power outage or disruption in Suddenlink's broadband network service. </li>
				<li><u>Calling Plans</u>.&nbsp; Customer expressly agrees that Customer will not have the option of subscribing to a "local only" or "long-distance only" service, nor will Customer be able to subscribe to a separate local, toll or long distance provider for use in conjunction with the Phone Service.</li>
			</ol>
		<li><strong><u>Service Charges Related To Phone Service</u></strong><strong>.</strong> </li>
			<ol start="1" type="1">

				<li><u>Taxes</u>.&nbsp; The Customer is responsible for the payment of any applicable sales, use, gross receipts, excise, access or other local, state and federal taxes, fees or surcharges (however designated) based upon the provision of Phone Service, all of which will be separately designated on Customer's invoice.&nbsp; It shall be the responsibility of the Customer to pay any such taxes that subsequently become applicable retroactively. </li>
				<li><u>Regulatory Fees</u>.&nbsp; Customer also agrees to pay any applicable fees or payment obligations in connection with the Phone Service that may be imposed by governmental or quasi-governmental bodies in connection with the sale, installation, use, or provision of the Phone Service and any regulatory fees that Suddenlink invoices Customer for to help defray Suddenlink's contribution to municipal, state and federal government programs in which Suddenlink participates, including but not limited to, universal service, telecom relay services for the visually/hearing impaired, 911/E911 programs and associated infrastructure.&nbsp; Suddenlink, in its sole discretion, has the right to determine what fees, taxes and surcharges are due by Customer and to collect and remit them to the governmental authority.&nbsp; The Suddenlink Parties shall in no way be liable to Customer for the collection or remittance of any fees, taxes and surcharges. </li>
				<li><u>Surcharges</u>.&nbsp; A surcharge may be imposed on&nbsp; charges for Phone Service originating from states which levy, or assert a claim of right to levy, a gross receipts tax on Suddenlink's operations in any such state, or a tax on interstate access charges incurred by Suddenlink for originating access to telephone exchanges in that state. This surcharge is based on state imposed receipts tax and other state taxes imposed directly or indirectly upon Suddenlink by virtue of, and measured by, the gross receipts or revenues of Suddenlink in that state and/or payment of interstate access charges in that state. Surcharges may also be imposed for international directory assistance, international mobile termination fees charged by foreign wireless telecommunication providers, operator assisted calls, and calls made to premium services such as chat lines.&nbsp; Any applicable surcharge will be shown as a separate line item on the Customer's monthly invoice. </li>

				<li><u>Wiring</u>.&nbsp; Customer agrees that Suddenlink and its authorized agents may disconnect Customer's existing service to the local telephone company, and that Suddenlink or its authorized agent may disconnect, rearrange, splice or otherwise manipulate the existing telephone wiring in or on Customer's premises in order to connect the premises to the Phone Service.&nbsp; </li>
			</ol>
		<li><strong><u>Use of Phone Service</u></strong><strong>.</strong> </li>

				<li><u>No Commercial Use</u>.&nbsp; Customer agrees not to use the Phone Service for any commercial reason, including telemarketing, medical transcription, facsimile broadcasting, or other enterprise directed at receiving income or profit.

If Customer uses the Phone Service for any other purpose,&nbsp; Suddenlink may immediately suspend, restrict or cancel your service without prior notice </li>
				<li><u>Interference/Hazardous Conditions</u>.&nbsp; Suddenlink may shut down Customer's Phone Service without prior notice if Suddenlink finds, in Suddenlink's sole judgment, that Customer's use of the Service is causing interference to others or Customer has moved or tampered or allowed others to tamper with any Equipment.&nbsp; Suddenlink may also shut down Customer's Phone Service without prior notice if Suddenlink finds, in Suddenlink's sole judgment, that hazardous conditions exist that would make Customer's continued use of the Service unsafe. </li>
			</ol>
		<li><strong><u>Phone Numbers/Portability</u></strong><strong>.</strong> </li>
			<ol start="1" type="1">
				<li><u>Switching to Suddenlink from Another Provider</u>. &nbsp;If Customer is switching to Phone Service from another service provider, Customer may transfer Customer's existing phone number (if any) to the Phone Service, provided that the following conditions apply: </li>

		  <li>Customer acknowledges and agrees  that if Customer's EMTA is self-installed (where Suddenlink makes that option  available) before the date that the number transfer becomes effective ("Port  Effective Date"), Customer should keep Customer's current phone service until  after the Port Effective Date, after which Customer will be able both to make  and to receive calls using the Phone Service.&nbsp; Customer acknowledges and  agrees that to avoid an interruption in telephone service, Customer must have  the EMTA installed on or before the Port Effective Date.&nbsp; Customer's  current telephone service for the number that Customer is transferring will be  disconnected on the Port Effective Date; if Customer's EMTA is not yet activated,  Customer will not have access to Phone Service.&nbsp; Suddenlink will provide  Customer with an estimate of the Port Effective Date at the time of service  ordering or via e-mail following Customer's completion of the ordering process. </li>
	
		  <li>In the event that the Customer  desires to cancel or reschedule the date that the Customer desires Phone  Service ("Customer Requested Due Date"), Customer must notify Suddenlink no  later than three days prior to the Customer Requested Due Date in order to  assure Customer will not experience interruption in telephone service. </li>
