Journeys recognizes that it must maintain and use customer information responsibly. The information collected is used to help us respond to customer inquiries, send emails about sales and events, send catalogs and other marketing and promotional materials through the mail, contact contest winners and/or ship and bill orders. The information also helps us in determining what products appeal to our customers so we can better merchandise our site. <br /><br />Journeys collects personal information necessary to process an order, a catalog request, a contest entry or a request to receive promotional emails from the consumer.

That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotions to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations.

A cookie is a piece of information that is sent to your computer's hard drive to help our site recognize you when you return to our Site. Cookies are used as a standard practice by many sites. An example of how we use this function could be if you started to place items in your shopping cart, but then for some reason had to leave our Site or shut off your computer. When you return to our Site, the cookie would enable our Site to recognize that you have returned and all the items you placed in your cart during an earlier session would still be in your shopping cart. <br /><br />We also use cookies to determine the number of people that come to our Site. It is important for us to understand the number of new customers using our Site. When your computer accepts the cookie, we are able to record that session as a new visitor to our Site. <br /><br />As important as cookies are to our Site, we understand that this might make you uncomfortable. If you would prefer to not accept cookies from ours or any other Site, you can modify the setting on your specific web browser to not accept them. Please refer to your browser's online help feature or the user's manual for instructions on how to do this. <br /><br /><b>Use Of IP Addresses</b><br />An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you get on to the internet.
