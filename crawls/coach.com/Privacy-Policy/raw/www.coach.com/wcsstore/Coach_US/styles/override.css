/* All CSS changes, revisions, additions needed outside template development stage will be created in this document. Structure should look like this:
	.replaced_class { style-to-overide: value-overide !important; }
	.added_class { style: value; }
	#id { stlye: value; }
	tag { style: value; }
	
	
	For Overriding (changes and revisions): 
		Copy and paste class or id that needs to be changed with all styles. Replace the unwanted style within that class or id with the new one.
		
	For Troubleshooting:
		If something breaks within the html, first check this file to see if its associated class has been altered. If it has, comment it out and doublecheck html. If not, reference css for style and apply formatting changes within this document as noted. */
