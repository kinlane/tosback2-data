				<p><b>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING THE SOFTWARE OR USING THE PRODUCT(S) OR SKYPE WEBSITES</b></p>
<p><b>Key Points</b></p>
<p>It is important that you read the entirety of and understand this document. There are, however, a few key points that we need to emphasise:</p>
<p><b>NO ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES:</b> The Software is not a replacement for your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone. In particular, apart from in the very limited circumstances set out in paragraph 5.6 of these Terms (applicable to Skype’s Internet Communications Software only), the Software does not allow you to make emergency calls to emergency services. You must make alternative communications arrangements to ensure that you can make emergency calls if needed.</p>
<p><b>CHECK RESTRICTIONS ON USE:</b> In some countries there are restrictions on the use of the Software. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use the Software where you are located.</p>
<p><b>NO OWNERSHIP OF NUMBERS:</b> If Skype allocates you an <a href="http://beta.skype.com/en/features/online-number/">Online Number</a> or <a href="http://beta.skype.com/en/features/skype-to-go-number/">Skype To Go Number</a>, you do not own number or have a right to retain that number forever. Skype may need to change or withdraw the number allocated to you from time to time. You will not transfer or attempt to transfer your <a href="http://beta.skype.com/en/features/online-number/">Online Number</a> or <a href="http://beta.skype.com/en/features/skype-to-go-number/">Skype To Go Number</a> to anyone else. You must ensure you comply with any allocation requirements displayed when purchasing an Online Number as failure to do so could result in the number being withdrawn. Please see also paragraph 19.1.</p>
<p><b>SKYPE CREDIT BECOMES INACTIVE AFTER 180 DAYS:</b> If you purchase Skype Credit please be aware that it becomes inactive after 180 days of inactivity. Please see also paragraph 9.2.<br>
</p>

<p><a name="2"></a><b>2. ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS</b></p>
<p><b>2.1</b> In order to download and/or use the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites you must first accept these Terms.

<p><b>2.3</b>In some countries the Products may be provided to you by Skype’s local partner. If so, that local partner may ask you to accept its own terms of service (“local terms”). If there is any inconsistency between those local terms and these Terms, then the local terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a name="3"></a><b>3. CHANGES TO THE TERMS</b></p>
<p><b>3.1</b> Skype may make changes to these Terms from time to time. Skype will publish the changes at <a href="http://www.skype.com/go/tou">www.skype.com/go/tou</a> . Changes to the fair usage policies and/or Additional Terms will be posted on the applicable Skype Website. The changes will be effective when published. Please review the Terms on a regular basis. You understand and agree that your express acceptance of the Terms or your use of the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites after the date of publication shall constitute your agreement to the updated Terms. If you do not agree with the amended Terms, you may terminate your relationship with Skype in accordance with paragraph 11 below.</p>
<p><a name="4"></a><b>4. LICENCE</b></p>
<p><b>4.1</b> <b>Licence</b>. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, free of charge license to download and install the Software on a personal computer, mobile phone or other device; and personally use the Software through your individual Skype or Qik user account (as applicable) (“<b>User Account</b>”). For the avoidance of doubt, (a) IT administrators working on behalf of a company may download and install the Skype Software onto personal computers or other devices used by personnel of such company; and (b) you are permitted to use the Software at a university or other educational institution, or at work. Skype reserves all rights not expressly granted to you under these Terms.</p>
<p><b>4.2 Restrictions.</b> You may not and you agree not to.</p>
<p>(a) sub-license, sell, assign, rent, lease, export, import, distribute or transfer or otherwise grant rights to any third party in the Software;</p>
<p>(b) undertake, cause, permit or authorize the modification, creation of derivative works or improvements, translation, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, decryption, emulation, hacking, discovery or attempted discovery of the source code or protocols of the Software or any part or features thereof (except to the extent permitted by law);</p>
<p>(c) remove, obscure or alter any copyright notices or other proprietary notices included in the Software;</p>
<p>(d) use the Software or cause the Software (or any part of it) to be used within or to provide commercial products or services to third parties. The foregoing shall not preclude you using the Software for your own business communications, subject to Section 4.1 above;</p>
<p>(e) other than for the purposes of download and installation, use the Software except through your User Account.</p>
<p><b>4.3 Third Party Technology.</b> If you are using Software pre-loaded on, embedded in, combined, distributed or used with or downloaded onto third party products, hardware, software applications, programs or devices (“<b>Third Party Technology</b>”), you agree and acknowledge that: (a) you may be required to enter into a separate licence agreement with the relevant third party owner or licensor for the use of such Third Party Technology; (b) some Products and/or functionality may not be accessible through the Third Party Technology and (c) Skype cannot guarantee that the Software shall always be available on or in connection with such Third Party Technology.</p>
<p><b>4.4 Third Party Notices.</b> The Software may include third party code that Skype, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code are included for your information only. Third party scripts, linked to, called or referenced from the Software, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such code, not by Skype.</p>
<p><a name="5"></a><b>5. USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS AND SKYPE WEBSITES</b></p>
<p><b>5.1 Equipment:</b> In order to use the Software and the Products you will need an Internet broadband connection. You are responsible for providing all equipment required to access the Internet or enable communications such as headsets, microphones and webcams.</p>
<p><b>5.2 Use of Your Equipment:</b> The Internet Communications Software may use the processing capabilities, memory and bandwidth of the computer (or other applicable device) you are using, for the limited purpose of facilitating the communication and establishing the connection between Internet Communications Software users. If your use of the Internet Communications Software is dependent upon the use of a processor and bandwidth owned or controlled by a third party, you acknowledge and agree that your licence to use the Internet Communications Software is subject to you obtaining consent from the relevant third party for such use. You represent and warrant that by accepting these Terms, you have obtained such consent.</p>
<p><b>5.3 Updates to the Software:</b> Skype may automatically check your version of the Skype Software. You may be required to enter into an updated version of these Terms to be able to download or otherwise take advantage of any Updates. Skype has no obligation to make available any Updates. However, Skype may (a) require you to download and install Updates; or (b) download and install Updates from Skype automatically from time to time unless you have chosen (through your Skype client settings) not to receive automatic Updates. Microsoft may also automatically download updates to the Skype Software for Windows, if you have chosen to receive Microsoft Updates. These updates are required to maintain software compatibility, provide security updates or bug fixes, or offer new features, functionality or versions. You agree to receive such updates from Skype in order to continue using the Skype Software and you agree to accept such Updates subject to these Terms.</p>
<p><b>5.4 Suspension, technical improvement and maintenance:</b> From time to time, Skype may need to perform maintenance on or upgrade the Software, Products or Skype Websites or the underlying infrastructure that enables you to use the Software, Products or Skype Websites. This may require Skype to temporarily suspend or limit your use of some or all of the Software, Products or Skype Websites until such time as this maintenance and/or upgrade can be completed. To the extent possible and unless an intervention is urgently required, Skype will publish the time and date of such suspension or limitation on the Skype Website in advance. You will not be entitled to claim damages for such suspension or limitation of the use of any Software, Product or Skype Website.</p>
<p><b>5.5 No Access to Emergency Services:</b> Neither the Products nor the Software are intended to support or carry emergency calls to any type of hospitals, law enforcement agencies, medical care unit or any other kind of services that connect a user to emergency services personnel or public safety answering points (‘Emergency Services’) . There are important differences between traditional telephone services and the Products. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Skype is not required to offer access to Emergency Services under any applicable local and/or national rules, regulations or law; (ii) it is your responsibility to purchase, separately from the Products, traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services that offer access to Emergency Services, and (iii) the Software and the Products are not a replacement for your primary telephone service. Find out more about calling 112, the dedicated emergency number for the EU at <a href="http://www.skype.com/go/emergency">www.skype.com/go/emergency</a>.</p>
<p><b>5.6 Limited Emergency Calling (Internet Communications Software Only and Not Applicable to the Qik Software)</b></p>
<p><b>5.6.1</b>In a very limited number of countries, and for defined Internet Communications Software versions and platforms only, Skype will try to provide limited emergency calling as a stand-alone feature but can provide no commitment in this respect. Click here for the listing of countries (‘Enabled Countries’) and software versions and other platforms (‘Enabled Versions’) that enable limited Skype emergency calling. Skype emergency calling is not available for any other countries, versions or platforms. You should keep traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services available for your calls to Emergency Services and use Skype’s limited emergency calling only as an absolute last resort. In particular, please also note that:</p>
<p>(i) power cut, battery failure or internet connection failure can lead to a Skype call failure, including your call to Emergency Services. Additionally, any of the quality limitations set out in paragraph 5.9 below, may otherwise affect successful call connection.</p>
<p>(ii) where available, an emergency call made using the Internet Communications Software in an enabled country may not receive the same network priority as a call made using traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services.</p>
<p>(iii) if your emergency call is connected, you will need to tell the Emergency Services operator that you speak to where you are physically located so that the correct emergency organisation can respond to your emergency and knows where to find you. If you do not provide this information when prompted, you acknowledge that your emergency call may not be completed and you will not be able to gain access to your required Emergency Services using the Internet Communications Software. Skype will have no liability for your failed emergency call in such circumstances.</p>
<p>(iv) other than for the Enabled Countries and Enabled Versions, Skype does not provide limited emergency calling in any country or for or in conjunction with any Products or using any platforms, devices, services or operating systems (including any products, platforms, devices, services or operating systems developed by third parties using Skype’s APIs, any of Skype’s software development kits or otherwise).</p>
<p><b>5.6.2</b> In Enabled Countries, you should configure the limited emergency calling functionality by setting your default location for emergency calling in the Call Settings page of your desktop Internet Communications Software (if you are using a 4.1 version for Windows (or later) or version 2.8 for Mac OS X (or later)). It is your responsibility to ensure that this location information is correct and kept up-to-date if your physical address changes. Skype does not support emergency calls in the majority of countries around the world. Where limited emergency calling is supported Skype will not charge you to make an emergency call and you do not need to have a Skype Credit balance. If however your country is not supported for limited emergency calling then you should not attempt to, and agree not to, make any emergency calls using your Internet Communications Software. If, with your permission, another user uses your User Account, it is your responsibility to inform that user of the limited circumstances in which limited emergency calling is available.</p>
<p><b>5.7</b> Content of Communications: Skype is not the source of, does not verify or endorse and takes no responsibility for the content of communications made using the Software. By using the Software, you agree that any content that you submit may be transmitted to the recipient of your communication. The content of communications is entirely the responsibility of the person from whom such content originated. You therefore may be exposed to content that is offensive, unlawful, harmful to minors, obscene, indecent or otherwise objectionable. The content of communications may be protected by intellectual property rights, which are owned by third parties. You are responsible for the content you choose to communicate and access using the Software. In particular, you are responsible for ensuring that you do not submit material that is (i) copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner (ii) a falsehood or misrepresentation (iii) offensive, unlawful, harmful to minors, obscene, defamatory, libellous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or that encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, gives rise to civil liability, violates any law, or is otherwise objectionable; (iv) an advertisement or solicitation of business; or (v) impersonating another person. Skype reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to review content for the purpose of enforcing these Terms. Skype may in its sole discretion block, prevent delivery of or otherwise remove the content of communications as part of its effort to protect the Software, Products or its customers, or otherwise enforce these Terms. Further, Skype may in its sole discretion remove such content and/or terminate these Terms and your User Account if you use any content that is in breach of these Terms.</p>
<p><b>5.8 Notice and Take-Down</b> If Skype receives any notification that any material that you post, upload, edit, host, share and/or publish on the Skype Website or through the Software (excluding your private communications) (“<b>User Submission</b>”) is inappropriate, infringes any rights of any third party, or if Skype wishes to remove your User Submission for any reason whatsoever, Skype reserves the right to automatically remove such User Submission for any reason immediately or within such other timescales as may be decided from time to time by Skype in its sole discretion. The User Submission shall be taken down without any admission as to liability and without prejudice to any rights, remedies or defenses, all of which are expressly reserved. You acknowledge and agree that Skype is under no obligation to put back such User Submission at any time. If User Submissions infringe, or if you believe that User Submissions infringe any of your rights (including intellectual property rights) or are unlawful, please contact us immediately by following our notice and takedown procedure. Click here to view the <a href="http://qik.com/info/takedown_policy">Notice and Takedown Procedure</a>. Skype reserves the right to ask for verification of your identity and to seek further information to verify your complaint. You agree that you are solely responsible for the consequences resulting from your complaint (including but not limited to removal or blocking of the User Submission) and you acknowledge and agree that any complaint may be used in court proceedings. Any false, misleading or inaccurate information provided by you may result in civil and criminal liability.</p>
<p><b>5.9 Quality:</b> Skype cannot guarantee that the Software, Products or Skype Websites will always function without disruptions, delay or errors. A number of factors may impact the quality of your communications and use of the Software, Products (depending on the Products used) or Skype Websites, and may result in the failure of your communications including but not limited to: your local network, firewall, your internet service provider, the public internet, the public switched telephone network and your power supply. Skype takes no responsibility for any disruption, interruption or delay caused by any failure of or inadequacy in any of these items or any other items over which we have no control.</p>

<p><a name="8"></a><b>8. CHARGES</b></p>
<p><b>8.1 Calling phones and premium rate numbers with Skype Credit:</b></p>
<p>(i) <b>Calling landlines and mobiles:</b> The charges payable for calling phones (outside of a subscription) consist of a connection fee (charged once, per call) and a per-minute rate as set out on www.skype.com/go/allrates. All calls will be disconnected and require a re-dial after a 4-hour duration and an additional connection fee will be charged on re-dial.</p>
<p>(ii) <b>Premium rate numbers:</b> The charges payable for calling premium rate numbers consist of a per-minute rate available at www.skype.com/go/rates-premium. No connection fee is payable.</p>
<p>(iii) Skype may change the rates for calling phones and premium rate numbers at any time without notice to you by posting such change at www.skype.com/go/allrates. The new rate will apply to your next purchase after the new rates have been published. Please check the latest rates before you make your call. If you do not accept the new rates, do not make your call.</p>
<p>(iv) The duration of a call shall be based on one-minute increments. Fractions of minutes will be rounded up to the next minute. The connection fee, where applicable, will be charged at the beginning of the call. At the end of a call, fractional cent charges will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent, for example a total call price of €0.034 will be rounded up to €0.04. During the call, charges incurred will be deducted automatically from the Skype Credit balance in your User Account.</p>
<p><b>8.2 Charges for other Paid For Products:</b> The charges for other Paid For Products will be confirmed to you before you complete a purchase from Skype. Skype may change the charges payable for the purchase of such Products at any time without any notice to you. You can choose whether or not to accept the new charges prior to completing your next purchase of the applicable Product. The new charges will apply to your next purchase after the new charges have been published.</p>
<p><b>8.3 Promotional Offers:</b> From time to time, Skype may offer Paid-For Products for free for a trial period. Skype reserves the right to charge you for such Products (at the normal rate) in the event that Skype determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are abusing the terms of the offer, including if you are using any service, proxy or other devices or anonymous IP address that prevents us from locating you.</p>
<p><b>8.4 Tax:</b> 15% Luxembourg VAT generally applies if you are located in the EU and if you don’t have a VAT registration number. Skype reserves the right to apply VAT at the appropriate rate as per VAT rules applicable at the time of purchase. 8% Swiss VAT applies if you are located in Switzerland. Other local taxes may apply in certain countries. If you are located in the EU and if you have a VAT registration number, you are liable to self-assess VAT in your country at the appropriate rate as per the reverse charge rules applicable in your country. When you purchase a voucher depending on the country, local VAT or other taxes may apply and may be deducted from the value of the voucher upon redemption. The territories in the EU set out below are outside the scope of EU VAT under Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT, as amended. The Skype Website does not enable users in such territories to take advantage of this VAT exemption and we therefore do not provide the Products in such territories: Mount Athos, Canary Islands, French Overseas Departments, Aland Islands, Channel Islands, Heligoland Island, Busingen Territory, Ceuta, Melilla, Levigno, Campioned'Italia and Italian Waters of Lake Lugano.</p>
<p><b>8.5 Third Party Charges:</b> Using the Software on mobile applications will use some of the data allowance available on the data package to which you have subscribed with your mobile network operator. Out-of-country usage may lead to significantly higher costs than regular usage, and you are solely responsible for keeping yourself informed and paying for possible roaming and other applicable charges levied by your mobile network operator.</p>
<p><a name="9"></a><b>9. PAYMENT</b></p>
<p><b>9.1 Skype Credit.</b> You can pay for select Paid-For Products using Skype Credit. You can purchase Skype Credit using any payment method made available to you by Skype from time to time. The Skype Credit that you purchase will be credited to your User Account at the time of purchase (or if you are using a Skype Credit voucher, at the time you redeem that voucher).</p>
<p><b>9.2 Inactive Skype Credit.</b> If you do not use your Skype Credit for a period of 180 days, (including Skype Credit that has been allocated to you by a Skype Manager administrator) Skype will place your Skype Credit on inactive status. You can reactivate the Skype Credit by following the reactivation link in My Account at <a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/credit-reactivate">https://secure.skype.com/account/credit-reactivate</a>. Reactivated Skype Credit is not refundable. If you are located in Japan and you buy Skype Credit from the Skype Website, this paragraph does not apply to you and your Skype Credit shall expire 6 months from the date of purchase. You are not permitted to use any Skype Credit on or after the date of its expiry.</p>
<p><b>9.3 Other payment methods.</b> Skype does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Skype Credit balance to purchase all Products. Where Skype Credit cannot be used to pay for a Product, Skype will make another payment method available to you. Skype reserves the right to remove or amend the available payment methods at its sole discretion.</p>
<p><b>9.4 Recurring Payments.</b> Where you purchase Products on a subscription basis (monthly, every 3 months or annually (as applicable)), you acknowledge and agree that this is a recurring payment and payments shall be made to Skype by the method you have chosen at the recurring intervals chosen by you, until the subscription for that Product is terminated by you or by Skype.</p>
<p><b>9.5 Auto-Recharge.</b></p>
<p>(a) The Auto-Recharge feature will be automatically enabled when you buy Skype Credit, unless you untick the appropriate box. Your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when you first sign up for Auto-Recharge, unless you subsequently change the amount by accessing your User Account. For example, if you purchase 10 Euros of Skype Credit with your credit card, the recharge amount charged to your credit card will also be 10 Euros of Skype Credit. In future the same amount will be charged to your credit card every time your Skype account balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from time to time. If you do not want to enable Auto-Recharge, please untick the box.</p>
<p>(b) If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription.</p>
<p>(c) You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing your User Account.</p>

<p><a name="19"></a><b>19. PRODUCT SPECIFIC TERMS</b></p>
<p><b>19.1 Online Numbers and Skype To Go numbers</b></p>
<p>(a) Availability and use. Where we provide you with an Online Number or Skype To Go number, you agree that:</p>
<p>(i) you do not own the number or have a right to retain that number forever;</p>
<p>(ii) the number provided to you is subject to applicable numbering rules and regulatory practices;</p>
<p>(iii) you will comply on an ongoing basis with any specific number allocation requirements that we make you aware of, or any reasonable instructions that Skype or Skype’s partners may give to you with regard to the use of the numbers and the Products;</p>
<p>(iv) you will not transfer or attempt to transfer your number to any third party. In particular, you are responsible for compliance with any requirements related to residency and or location; and</p>
<p>(v) you will supply accurate, complete and up-to-date information to us where we request it and inform us where such information changes. Skype reserves the right to change the terms related to Online Numbers and/or Skype To Go numbers, including without limitation to impose or amend any residency requirements and/or require the provision of further user information for continued access to such numbers. In certain countries, a number may be made available to you by a Skype partner rather than Skype, and you may need to enter into a separate agreement with such partner.</p>
<p>(b) Other changes to numbers. If Skype needs to withdraw or change the number that has been made available to you, Skype will use commercially reasonable endeavours to notify you by e-mail, stating the effective date of the change and where possible, your new number. If you do not wish to accept this new number, you are entitled to terminate your number.</p>
<p><b>19.2 User Account on Skype Manager</b></p>
<p>(a) You are not permitted to belong to more than one Skype Manager at the same time.</p>
<p>(b) Any online number purchased before 21 July 2009 and allocated to you by a Skype Manager administrator shall be taken back by the administrator of the Skype Manager, if you leave the Skype Manager account for any reason. The right to use the number and the cancellation of such right rest with the Skype Manager administrator at his/her sole discretion and not you.</p>
<p>(c) Personal and traffic data – Members. As a member of a Skype Manager account you acknowledge and agree that the administrator of the Skype Manager may, if you agree, view detailed information about the activity on your User Account including the time, date, duration and destination number of calls and SMS made and details of your purchases and downloads. You can withdraw your agreement at any time by changing the settings on your User Account. If you provide personal data including your name and job title to be included on the Skype Manager directory, you acknowledge that other members of that Skype Manager may view such data.</p>
<p><b>19.3 Subscriptions</b></p>
<p>(a) Fair Usage Policy. At Skype, we want all of our customers to get the best calling plans, known as ‘subscriptions’, at the lowest possible price. This Fair Usage Policy (&quot;FUP&quot;) is designed to prevent fraud and abuse of our subscriptions by a small number of users.</p>
<p>Subject to this FUP, Skype’s unlimited subscriptions allow unlimited calls to landlines in the applicable subscription countries (excluding special, premium, service and non-geographic numbers). Unlimited calls to mobiles may also be included where stated at the time of purchase. All calls will be disconnected and require a re-dial after a 2-hour duration.</p>
<p>Skype’s subscriptions are for personal, individual, non-commercial use only, in accordance with our Terms of Use and this FUP (“Legitimate Use”). The following is a non-exhaustive list of practices that would not be considered Legitimate Use:</p>
<p>(i)Using subscriptions for commercial purposes or commercial gain, for example telemarketing or call centre operations;</p>
<p>(ii)Re-selling subscription minutes;</p>
<p>(iii)Sharing subscriptions between users whether via a PBX, call centre, computer or any other means;</p>
<p>(iv)Calling numbers (whether individually, sequentially or automatically) to generate income for yourself or others as a result of placing the call;</p>
<p>(v)Regular calls of short duration or calls to multiple numbers in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Other practices may be relevant in determining Legitimate Use and Skype reserves the right to take any unlawful, prohibited, abnormal or unusual activity into account in making its determination. Skype may at its option, terminate its relationship with you, or may suspend your subscription immediately if it determines you are using your subscription contrary to this FUP or Skype’s Terms of Use. Where reasonable, Skype will provide you with notice of improper usage before suspension or termination of your subscription and, if appropriate, Skype may offer you an alternative subscription.</p>
<p>(b) Skype reserves the right to withdraw or change the subscriptions at any time. If Skype changes the Products included in your subscription, Skype will notify you by email stating the changes and their effective date. If you do not wish to accept these changes, you are entitled to terminate your subscription, with effect from the date on which the changes are due to take effect.</p>
<p>(c) The ‘Unlimited World Extra’ subscription has a minimum fixed term of 2 years from the date of purchase. You are not permitted to terminate it before the expiry of the 2-year minimum term except in case of breach by Skype of the Terms. This subscription is billed monthly as a recurring payment.</p>
<p><b>19.4 Spinvox for Skype</b></p>
<p>The maximum number of characters per SMS is 153 and no more than 3 SMS messages will be delivered per voicemail. You will be charged for each SMS sent as a result of a recorded voicemail, regardless of whether or not the caller leaves a message. We reserve the right to charge for any undelivered SMS message that we have been unable to convert from voicemail due to reasons beyond Skype's control. Only voicemails in English, French, German and Spanish will be converted to text.</p>
<p><b>19.5 Skype WiFi</b></p>
<p>Skype WiFi is provided by one of Skype’s WiFi partners. Your use of Skype WiFi is subject to that partner’s terms of service. Before you start a Skype WiFi session at a specific WiFi hotspot, you will be notified of the identity of the WiFi provider and their terms of service. You will have to read their terms of service, which you agree to be subject to by proceeding with the Skype WiFi session. You can pay for Skype WiFi using your Skype Credit balance, and your use of Skype Credit is subject to these Terms of Service.</p>
<p><b>19.6 SMS</b></p>
<p>Each SMS message has a limit of 160 characters. If you type a longer message it will be broken down into several SMS messages and you will be charged for each message sent. If you send SMS messages to more than one person you will be charged for each SMS sent to each recipient. If Skype cannot (for whatever reason) send your SMS, Skype will continue to try and send the message for up to 24 hours after which time the SMS charge will be refunded to your Skype Credit balance automatically if delivery is unsuccessful.</p>
<p><b>19.7 Group Video Calling</b></p>
<p>(a) A fair usage policy applies at http://www.skype.com/go/terms.gvc.fairusage and is incorporated herein by reference. Skype reserves the right to change the fair usage policy at any time. Changes shall become effective when published on the Skype Website. Your continued use of a Skype Premium Subscription after publication on the Skype Website shall constitute your acceptance to be bound by the terms and conditions of the revised fair usage policy.</p>
<p>(b) Number of Participants. The number of permitted participants on a group video call varies from 3 to a maximum of 10, subject to system requirements. You can find more details at http://www.skype.com/go/skypepremium.</p>
<p>(c) Audio Conversion. If a Skype Premium Subscription or Day Pass expires during a group video call, or it has exceeded the fair usage limit, or the owner of the Skype Premium Subscription leaves the call (and there is no other participant on the call who owns a Skype Premium Subscription), then the call will convert from video to audio.</p>
<p>(d) Software Versions. If a participant of a group video call is not on a version of Internet Communications Software that supports group video calls, then the call will be an audio call only for that participant. For details of the system requirements for group video calling, please see http://www.skype.com/go/skypepremium.requirements.</p>
<p>(e) Live chat. Live chat customer support is available as part of the Skype Premium Subscription. This support is available 24 hours a day, every day, and only in English.</p>
<p><b>19.8 Qik Premium Fair Usage Policy</b></p>
<p>Qik Premium is subject to a fair usage policy of 15GB of video storage per user per month and each video can be no more than 90 minutes in duration. Once these limits have been reached you cannot upload any new videos in that month or continue recording beyond the 90-minute mark.</p>
<p>Skype reserves the right to change the fair usage policy at any time. Changes shall become effective when published on the Skype Website. Your continued use of Qik Premium after publication on the Skype Website shall constitute your acceptance to be bound by the terms and conditions of the revised fair usage policy.</p>
<p><b>19.9 Skype Video Messaging (“Video Messaging”)</b></p>
<p>If you are a Skype Premium subscriber you can, subject to the Video Messaging Fair Use Policy (“FUP”) below, send and receive an unlimited number of Video Messages and any Video Messages you send and/or receive shall have no expiry date.</p>
<p>If you are not a Skype Premium subscriber, the number of Video Messages you can send are limited, however you can receive an unlimited number of Video Messages (again subject to the FUP below). As a non-Skype Premium subscriber any Video Message you send or receive will expire within 90 days, except for Video Messages received from a Skype Premium subscriber or where you upgrade to a Skype Premium subscription before the 90 day expiry period ends, and in either case the Video Message shall cease to have an expiry date.</p>
<p><b>Fair Use Policy:</b> This FUP is designed to prevent fraud and abuse of Video Messaging. Video Messaging is for personal, individual and non-commercial use only, and to be in accordance with these Terms at all times (“Legitimate Use”). Skype reserves the right to take any unlawful, prohibited, abnormal or unusual activity into account in making its determination as to whether your activity does not constitute Legitimate Use. Skype may in its option, terminate its relationship with you, or suspend your account immediately if it determines you are using Video Messaging contrary to this FUP or these Terms.</p>
