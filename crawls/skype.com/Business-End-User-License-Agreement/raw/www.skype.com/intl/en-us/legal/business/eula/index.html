    <a href="index.html" id="manager" name="manager" shape="rect"></a>3. Skype Manager and Business Accounts
  </h2>  
  <p> 
    <strong>3.1 Purpose of Skype Manager.</strong> A Skype Manager enables You to manage Your business communications.  You may create Business Accounts on Your Skype Manager, and purchase and allocate Skype Products to Your Business Accounts for use by You and/or Your Business Users. You may also view reports of those communications.
  </p>  
  <p> 
    <strong>3.2 Permitted Use of Business Accounts.</strong>

  </p>  
  <p> 
    <strong>3.2.3</strong> You may set up and use a Business Account for the following purposes:
  </p>  
  <p>(i) the individual use of a Business Account by one Business User only, for the communications purposes of such Business User (

  </p>  
  <p> 
    <strong>3.4 Reallocation and Deletion of Business Accounts.</strong> If a Business Account has been allocated to a specific Business User for Individual Use and that Business User leaves the Company, such Business Account shall remain in the Skype Manager and may be allocated to another Business User. You may delete such Business Account from the Skype Manager rather than reallocate it to another Business User. If You choose to delete such Business Account then You acknowledge that the traffic data (including call history and text message history) in respect of a Business Account is only visible whilst that Business Account exists and such traffic data will no longer be accessible to You once that Business Account has been deleted, and You are therefore responsible for printing out the traffic data records if You deem this necessary, before deleting the relevant Business Account. Any Online Numbers and Skype Credit that You have allocated to that Business Account may be taken back to the Skype Manager and reallocated before the Business Account is deleted. You may take the Online Numbers back by manually removing them from the Business Account.

    <strong>3.5.2 Restriction on sharing.</strong> It is prohibited for You, Your Administrators and Business Users to: (i) share Business Accounts that are being used for Individual Use and (ii) share Passwords that are being used either for Individual Use or Shared Use. You shall ensure that neither You, Your Administrators or Business Users shall share a Business Account that is being used for Individual Use, or share Passwords.
  </p>  
  <p> 
    <strong>3.5.3. Security.</strong> You shall (and shall ensure that Your Administrators and Business Users shall) take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the User ID, Password and email address of Business Accounts at all times. If You suspect that any Password has been shared in breach of this Agreement or has become known to anyone other than an Administrator or a Business User to whom the Password has been allocated, then You shall ensure that such Password is immediately changed in order to protect Your Business Accounts.  It is Your responsibility to ensure that Your Business Users and Administrators do not respond to any unsolicited requests for credit card details, Passwords or other data.  Neither Skype nor its officers, employees or Affiliates may be held liable whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), or any other form of liability for any claim, damage, or loss arising from or relating to any failure by You, Your Administrators and/or Business Users to comply with this paragraph 3.5.3.
  </p>  
  <p> 
    <strong>3.6 Administrator(s)</strong> 
  </p>  
  <p> You and Your Administrators may appoint additional Administrators to Your Skype Manager, and each Administrator shall be required to accept and agree to this Agreement, the Business TOS and any other applicable Additional Terms. You shall procure that all Administrators read, agree to and comply with this Agreement, the Business TOS and any other applicable Additional Terms, and You shall be responsible for any breach  of the Terms by such Administrator(s). If you are an Administrator creating or managing a Skype Manager but not entering into this Agreement on behalf of a legally incorporated entity or you are not authorized to represent or act on behalf of such entity, then you shall be in breach of this Agreement and shall be personally liable for such breach and any other breach of this Agreement, and for any acts and omissions of any Business Users or Administrators on your Skype Manager. </p>
