	By accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information collection and 
	use practices described in this privacy statement.

	<strong>Collecting Your Personal Information </strong><br>We will ask you 
	when we need information that personally identifies you (personal 
	information) or allows us to contact you to provide a service or carry out a 
	transaction that you have requested such as requesting information about 
	OTA, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining OTA, signing up for an event or 
	training. The personal information we collect may include your name, title, 
	company or organization name, work e-mail, work phone, work or home address,

	credit card information. <br>&nbsp;<br>When you register for an event on our site 
	you are asked for your name, email address and billing information (such as 
	credit card number and expiration date). &nbsp;Although the event registration 
	page has the same look and feel as <a href="https://otalliance.org">
	https://otalliance.org</a> you may actually be submitting registration 
	information to our third party service provider who then shares the 
	information back with <a href="https://otalliance.org">

	request.&nbsp; Please note that our privacy statement does apply and that 
	our service provider must treat your personal information in accordance with 
	our privacy statement.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your security is important to our third party 
	service provider.&nbsp; When you enter sensitive information (such as credit 
	card number) on the event registration form, they encrypt that information 
	using secure socket layer technology (SSL).<br><br>The Site may collect 
	certain anonymous information about your visit, such as the name of the 
	Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through

	companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They 
	are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are 
	prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	OTA may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the 
	good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts 
	of the law or comply with legal process served on OTA or the Site; (b) 
	protect and defend the rights or property of OTA or (c) act in urgent 
	circumstances to protect the personal safety of OTA employees or agents, 
	users of OTA products or services, or members of the public.<br><br>We will 
	retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed 
	to provide you services. &nbsp;If you wish to cancel your account or request that
