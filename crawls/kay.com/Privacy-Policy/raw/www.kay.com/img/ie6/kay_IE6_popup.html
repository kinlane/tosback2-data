	  <h2>Why is Internet Explorer 6 no longer supported?</h2>
	    IE 6 was released in 2001. It doesn't have the same features as today's modern browsers. Continuing to support IE6 prevents us from delivering improvements that would benefit the majority of our users who use modern web browsers.
	  <h2>Upgrading is fast and free</h2>
	    Upgrading will improve your web browsing experience on this website and every site you visit. Try <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/products/ie/home">Microsoft&nbsp; Internet Explorer 8</a> - you can also use <a href="www.mozilla.com/">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>, or <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> if you already have one of them.
	    <h2>What if I want to keep using Internet Explorer 6 anyway?</h2>
	    Continuing to use this site with an unsupported browser is not recommended. Major areas of the site's functionality are broken or could stop working any time in the future. No fixes are forthcoming, and no assistance is available for those still using Internet Explorer 6.
