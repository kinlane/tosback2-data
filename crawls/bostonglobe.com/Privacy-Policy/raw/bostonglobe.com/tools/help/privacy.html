<p>
<b class="b">WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU? </b>

</p>
<p>The information gathered by the Services falls into two categories: (1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our sites, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and (2) Non-personal information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected as you use the Services.</p>
<p>
<i class="i"><b class="b">Personal Information That You Give Us</b>
</i>

</p>
<p>
<b class="b">Registration Information</b>: There is a free registration process required to access the full range of information and services offered across Boston Globe Web sites.</p>
<p>
<b class="b"><span class="span" id="U50323924357fP" style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; ;">Boston.com and BostonGlobe.com</span> </b>require that you supply a unique e-mail address, your first and last name, and basic demographic information (zip code, birth year, and gender) in order to register. In addition, we may ask you to supply optional information on household income, job industry, and job title. In addition, BostonGlobe.com requires that you supply your credit card number or other billing information, address, and phone number. You must also agree to our <a class="a" href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/tools/help/terms-service">Terms of Service</a> as part of the registration process.</p>
<p>
<b class="b">Boston Globe newspaper subscriber information</b>: We generally obtain your name, address, telephone number, credit card number or other billing information in order to process your newspaper subscription request. As a subscriber, we request that you also provide us with your e-mail address. If you use the Boston Globe Services Web site to manage your home delivery service, your newspaper subscriber information will be used to process online customer service requests relating to issues such as missing or late deliveries, and vacation stops and restarts.</p>
<p>
<b class="b">Registration for our Web sites via Third-Party Tools</b>: To help facilitate Boston.com registration, we offer a single sign-on service that allows you to sign in by using third party login credentials from your Facebook account. This allows you to associate your existing Facebook profile with your registration account. Boston.com may also access certain profile information contained within your Facebook profile such as your full name, e-mail address, year of birth, and profile picture. In order to complete your registration in this manner, you may be required to temporarily leave our websites. To disassociate your Facebook account from your registration account, click the &ldquo;Remove connection&rdquo; link in our <a class="a" href="http://members.boston.com/reg/login.do?dispatch=editpage">Member Center</a>. You must be logged into your Boston.com registration account and your Facebook account to make this change.</p>
<p>
<b class="b">Premium Products and Services</b>: We collect and store billing and credit card information where required for certain purchase transactions (such as paying for a subscription or classified advertisement). This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<b class="b">User Generated Content (Including comments, profiles, and photo uploads)</b>: We offer opportunities for you to engage in public activities on Boston.com and BostonGlobe.com, including submitting comments and photos in a number of areas throughout the Services. Forums, article comments, and profiles are currently hosted by Pluck, a third party vendor. Any information you disclose in your submissions, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by The Boston Globe for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.</p>
<p>If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these areas, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for this information. For more information, see the <a class="a" href="http://www.boston.com/help/message_board_rules/">Posting Policy</a> and read the User Generated Content section of the <a class="a" href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/tools/help/terms-service">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Public activities&rdquo; are actions you take on Boston.com and BostonGlobe.com that are designed to be visible to other users, including but not limited to comments on articles or blogs, participation in forums or discussion groups, personal blogs, and photo uploads. This feature may be disabled on the &ldquo;edit profile&rdquo; page. We may also feature, either through automation or by editor selection, specific user profiles or public activities to be promoted anywhere on the Services. If you choose to engage in public activities on Boston.com and BostonGlobe.com, we will track and aggregate these public activities on your profile page.</p>
<p>When you share or recommend (with or without adding your own comments) any articles or content from the Services to your Facebook profile, that action is governed by the Facebook Privacy Policy. We do not track or store a record of those comments or actions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
<b class="b">Contests, Sweepstakes, and Special Offers</b>: On occasion, The Boston Globe collects personal information from users or subscribers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests, or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than The Boston Globe we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest, or special offer.</p>
<p>Occasionally, The Boston Globe will run contests that registered members can enter by posting on the forums. Winners of some of these contests may be contacted for prize fulfillment purposes at the e-mail addresses provided while registering for the site. If winners are to be contacted in this manner, it will be stated in the contest rules. If you do not want to be contacted, you may always decline to participate in the contest.</p>
<p>
<b class="b">Special Events and Promotions</b>: We often receive contact information regarding customers who attend Special Events and Promotions. Such information will be used as indicated at the time of collection.</p>
<p>
<b class="b">Online Customer Panels</b>: We offer readers and customers the opportunity to participate in online research panels. These customers agree to participate in periodic surveys about their usage of products produced by The Boston Globe, their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior. Panel members are primarily contacted via e-mail, but may occasionally be contacted by telephone or postal mail. All survey data is reported/used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released. As a panel member, we require that you supply us with your e-mail address only; name, home address and telephone number are optional. </p>
<p>
<b class="b">Market Research and User Surveys</b>: Reader surveys and market research are valuable tools that help us better respond to consumer needs and opinions and help shape our product offerings. We may collect additional personal information from members in connection with optional reader surveys and market research activities. Information that you provide to answer optional survey or market research questions may be shared, in aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.</p>
<p>
<i class="i"><b class="b">Non-Personal Information Collected Using Technology</b>
</i>

</p>
<p>
<b class="b">Information Collected by Us Using Technology</b>

</p>
<p>
<b class="b">Device Information</b>: We may collect non-personal information about the computer, mobile device, or other device you use to access the Services, such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information.</p>
<p>
<b class="b">Cookies</b>: In providing the Services, we use &ldquo;cookies,&rdquo; Web beacons and other similar technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. You will not be able to access certain areas of our Web sites if your computer does not accept cookies from us. For more detailed information about our use of cookies, see <a class="a" href="http://www.boston.com/help/cookie_faq/">Frequently Asked Questions about Cookies</a> in our Help section.</p>
<p>We use a commercial advertising server to display ads on our sites and we use cookies to manage the display and frequency of advertisements that we sell and/or serve. </p>
<p>We also reserve the right to place a New York Times Company cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular webpage.</p>
<p> We use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>
<b class="b">Usage Data</b>: We are currently contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers on our Web sites. We use this information to track the traffic, usability, performance, and effectiveness of our Web sites. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of our websites is owned and used by The Boston Globe.
