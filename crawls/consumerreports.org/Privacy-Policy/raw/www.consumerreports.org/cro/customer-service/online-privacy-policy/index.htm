                        <p>Consumers Union of United States, Inc., doing business as Consumer Reports, is an independent, nonprofit testing, research,
                           and information organization serving consumers. Since 1936, our mission has been to test products, inform the public, protect
                           consumers and advocate on their behalf. Our Privacy Policy provides information on how we collect and use consumer information
                           provided to us through all channels, including online, mobile/wireless, telephonic, direct mail or other communications and
                           interactions. Our organization is referred to throughout this Privacy Policy as "Consumer Reports," "CR," "we" or "us." The

                           the Policy as "our Sites" and "our products and services."

                        <p class="pSpan">There are many features on our Sites for which no personally identifiable information is required to be provided by you. However,
                           you will need to provide us with personal information about yourself if you are interested in obtaining certain information,
                           purchasing our products and services, making a donation, or participating in other activities with CR, such as sweepstakes,
                           contests or other special initiatives. And if you use any third-party social media services that may be integrated with our
                           products and services, we may receive personally identifiable information that you have made available to us via those services.
                           When you engage in these activities, we collect personally identifiable information about you, which may include some or all
                           of the following: your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, mobile phone number, PIN, payment card information,
                           a user name and password, age, and other demographic information. You attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone
                           number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you provide us with personally identifiable information, we may use it to help customize your experience online or provide
                           you with personalized email and direct-mail messages. We may use this information to implement your renewal of a subscription
                           for a product or service. We may track what electronic or direct-mail content you are interested in. We conduct such tracking
                           to focus our communications and provide you content, products and services and offers we believe may be of interest to you.
                        </p>
                        <p>We have separate policies for information provided in response to surveys. Please see our section regarding how we treat <a href="index.htm#surveys" title="surveys">surveys</a> below.
                        </p>
                        <p>We may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information to validate or update your
                           address, payment card or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy
                           of the information we collect, to enable us to fulfill our products and services, to target our communications so that we
                           can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business
                           purposes consistent with our mission.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Submission of User Product Reviews, Ratings and Comments</h4>
                        <p class="pSpan">We collect information that you voluntarily provide through various tools on our Sites, including messages you post in any
                           public discussion group (forums), user product reviews and ratings submitted through our review tool, and blog comments ("User
                           Generated Content"). In order to post a user review or blog comment, CR requires you to provide us with a user name (which
                           should be different from your real name) and other information, which may include your email address and/or geographical location.
                           Only your user name and geographical location will be posted with your review. Forums are available only to subscribers and
                           comments you make on a Forum are identified by your name as it appears on your CR billing records. User Generated Content
                           is public. If you don't want people to know your email address or any other personally identifiable information, do not include
                           that information in the text of any message you post publicly. If you submit user reviews, please be aware that we may share
                           your submissions with other Web sites or provide links to your submissions from other Web sites. The posting of User Generated
                           Content is subject to our <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/discussion/forums-discussion-guidelines/index.htm" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="40721" sys_dependentvariantid="795" sys_folderid="40719" sys_relationshipid="2569844" sys_siteid="308" title="Forum Guidelines">Forum Guidelines</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Information Collected Through Technology</h4>
                        <p class="pSpan">When you use any of our Sites or mobile products and services we or our service providers may collect tracking information
                           such as your browser type, mobile device, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider,
                           and pages visited on the Sites. We use this information for aggregate reporting so for example, we may want to know how long
                           the average user spends on our Sites or which pages or features get the most attention. We use this information to make our
                           Sites and other products and services more useful to you, to present you with content we believe you'll be interested in,
                           and to serve banner ads for Consumer Reports products and services on both our Sites and other web sites.
                        </p>
                        <p>Most aggregate information is collected via cookies, web beacons and other technical methods. For instance, we use Web beacons
                           (also known as clear gifs) on some of our Site pages in conjunction with cookies to compile statistics about site usage. Web
                           beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites or applications. We or our service
                           providers use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Sites, such as the frequency with which our users
                           visit various parts of our Sites and to measure site effectiveness or use of our other products and services, such as mobile
                           applications. We also use Web beacons in HTML e-mails that we send our visitors who have agreed to receive e-mail from us,
                           to determine whether our recipients have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. On their own, cookies
                           or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish Consumer
                           Reports with personally identifiable information, this information can be associated to the data stored in the cookies or
                           Web beacons. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to our service providers.
                           These technical methods allow us to make our Sites and other products and services, and any e-mails you have agreed to receive,
                           more interesting to you. You may render some Web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.
                        </p>
                        <p>We also use "cookies" to store, and sometimes to track, user information. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail
                           address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example,
                           registering or subscribing to our Sites. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server
                           and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our Sites to recognize your computer.
                           We use both temporary and persistent cookies. A temporary cookie tracks visitor activity during a session or visit and it
                           expires when you close your browser. We use them to provide continuity for your visit as you visit Web site pages. Persistent
                           cookies allow us to keep track of your user name and password (if you are a subscriber) so you don't have to re-enter that
                           information each time you visit. The Help function on most browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify
                           you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you won't be able to take
                           advantage of various features on our Sites that are available to other visitors.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Ad Serving</h4>
                        <p class="pSpan">We do not allow third-party ads on our Sites. We may place ads for Consumer Reports products or services on other Web sites
                           or provide some of our content to these other sites. If you view a Web page where ads or content appear for a Consumer Reports
                           service, the online site may place a cookie or Web beacon on your computer. This allows the site to recognize the computer
                           when it is used to return to that site, or to measure advertising response. This data is anonymous and is not linked to personal
                           data on the user's computer or any Consumer Reports databases. This data also may be used by the external site to measure
                           advertising effectiveness, content interest, and relevance. If you no longer wish to receive targeted ads for Consumer Reports
                           products and services and other advertisers on other websites, you can opt out at <script src="../../../../preferences.truste.com/webservices/js%3Fdomain=consumersunion.org&amp;type=epref" type="text/javascript"></script><a onclick="TRUSTeWidget.Tab.link()" style=" color: #176FCC; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;">Ad Choices</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Licensed Content</h4>
                        <p class="pSpan">Consumer Reports licenses content from various licensors for our products and services. Most such third-party content is hosted
                           directly by us. In a few cases, however, the company licensing content to Consumer Reports may host the content on their Web
                           servers, although our subscribers gain access to the content through our Sites. In such cases, the content licensor may collect
                           aggregate tracking information such as domain name and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses for those who access the hosted content.
                           <strong>Those companies are restricted from sharing or reselling any information collected.</strong></p>
                        <h3 class="article">THIRD PARTY SITES AND SERVICES</h3>
                        <p>Our Sites and other products and services may contain links to third-party Web sites or access to third-party services for
                           your convenience and information. If you disclose your personal information to third parties, whether through our Sites or
                           other products and services or through third-party sites throughout the Internet, different rules will apply to the use and
                           disclosure of personal information you disclose to them. We are not responsible for and do not control the privacy practices
                           or the content of those other sites or services so you should investigate their policies before you disclose your personal
                           information to them. Similarly, if you subscribe to or purchase a Consumer Reports product or service or communicate with
                           us through a company or service other than Consumer Reports, such as a magazine subscription service, an online book or magazine
                           store, digital application service provider, telecommunication service provider, or social media service, then the privacy

                           as your age, gender, and geographic location, (2) information about yourself and about your experiences with products and
                           services (some of which information may be personally identifying) and (3) your views and opinions on various topics.
                        </p>
                        <p>The following principles govern our use of the information we collect through surveys:</p>
                        <p>First, your survey responses will be used only in combination with those of other survey respondents to produce information
                           to help consumers in today's marketplace. Your individual responses will remain confidential to Consumer Reports (and our
                           agents and service providers) and will not be used for non-research purposes.
                        </p>
                        <p>Second, you will not receive marketing or other non-research materials as a result of participating in a survey, although
                           it is possible that you may receive such materials as a result of your prior business relationship as a customer or subscriber
                           of Consumer Reports' products or services, as a member of Consumer Reports or as a donor to our organization.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are two general exceptions to these principles:</p>
                        <p>(1) As part of our quality control efforts, if you participate in a survey, you may be contacted by Consumer Reports or its
                           agents to validate that you did take part in the survey; and
                        </p>
                        <p>(2) With your prior affirmative consent (if provided in your initial survey response), our researchers may follow up with
                           you based on your specific answers to a survey. For example, if you tell us you have a particular car model and we have additional
                           questions about that car, we may select you to participate in a second survey, but only if you provided us with affirmative
                           permission to do so in the initial survey.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you wish to decline participation in future surveys, we will honor your opt-out request as quickly as possible. If you
                           are a print (or other offline e.g., telephone) survey participant, you may opt out of receiving future offline surveys by
                           calling us at 1-800-234-1645 or by writing to us at:

                        <h4>Online Surveys</h4>
                        <p class="pSpan">If you are an online survey participant, we provide you with instructions on how to opt out of receiving future invitations
                           in each email survey invitation. If you opt out of any online survey, you will be opted out of all of our online surveys with
                           one important exception: the online version of our Annual Questionnaire. Each year Consumer Reports asks subscribers to participate
                           in a survey about cars, and other products and services. It is one of the largest surveys of its kind, and we use the answers
                           to create our unique reliability and service ratings that we make available to subscribers throughout the year. For information
                           on how to opt out of the print or online version of the Annual Questionnaire, see below.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Opting out of Annual Questionnaire and Ballot (print version)</h4>
                        <p class="pSpan">Please note that you must separately opt out of receiving the print version of our Annual Questionnaire, which is a survey
                           we send each year to paid annual subscribers to our magazine and ConsumerReports.org products who do not receive the online
                           version of the Questionnaire. The Annual Questionnaire is handled separately because it contains the ballot for the election
                           of our Board of Directors. If you opt out of the Annual Questionnaire, you will no longer receive a ballot for the election
                           of our Board of Directors unless you separately contact us for a ballot by calling us at 1-800-234-1645 or writing to us at
                           the address indicated above. Please keep in mind that if you elect to continue receiving the Annual Questionnaire and Ballot,
                           you can complete and return the ballot portion without completing the survey portion.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Opting out of Annual Questionnaire and Ballot (online version)</h4>
                        <p class="pSpan">The online version of our Annual Questionnaire is handled separately because like the print Annual Questionnaire, it also
                           contains the ballot for the election of our Board of Directors. If you no longer wish to receive the online Annual Questionnaire,
                           you must separately opt-out of that survey by following instructions at the bottom of the email invitation. If you opt out
                           of the Annual Questionnaire and Ballot, you will no longer receive a ballot for the election of our Board of Directors unless
                           you contact us for a ballot by calling us at 1-800-234-1645 or writing to us at the address indicated above. If you elect
                           to continue receiving the online Annual Questionnaire and Ballot, you can complete and return the online ballot without completing
                           the survey portion.

                        </h3>
                        <p>We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. We have put in place physical,
                           electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access and maintain security over the
                           data we collect. We use industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls and other security procedures to help protect
                           your information from loss or unauthorized access.
                        </p>
                        <p>We use data encryption technology to help protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your sensitive credit or debit card
                           information. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, which creates an encrypted connection between you and our systems
                           for the transmission of any credit or debit card information you input online and we use encryption protection for any payment
                           authorizations for transactions we request through any channel. Once we collect your credit card or debit card information,
                           it is stored encrypted on restricted-access computers that are not directly accessible via the Internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>Any unauthorized access to or use of any of our Sites and other products and services or to the information collected and
                           maintained by us should be immediately brought to our attention by contacting us via email or by writing to us at Consumer
                           Reports Customer Relations, Attn: Security, 101 Truman Avenue, Yonkers, NY 10703. We will investigate, and, if necessary,
                           take action to halt any violation of the security of your personal information of which we become aware.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the unlikely event that we believe the security of your personally identifiable information, such as payment card information,
                           in our possession or control has been compromised, we will endeavor to provide required notice as soon as possible under the

                        </p>
                        <h4>Security of Passwords and Pin Numbers and Public Forums</h4>
                        <p class="pSpan">When you set up an online account with us, you are asked to establish a user name and password. When you later log on to your
                           account, you will be asked to enter your user name and password to protect the security of your online account. If you want
                           to change your password or other subscriber information, you may do so at any time through My account. If you have forgotten
                           your user name and wish to log on, you will be asked to provide the email address you used when you created the account (or
                           an updated email address that you have previously provided), and an email containing your user name will be sent promptly
                           to that email address. If you wish to log on to your account and have forgotten your password, the online system will request
                           both your email address and your user name, and we will promptly send you an email with a temporary password. You will be
                           prompted to reset it to a new password.
                        </p>
                        <p>When you purchase 24 hours or 30 days' access to Consumer Reports Mobile, you will be asked to provide your mobile phone number,
                           wireless carrier and to establish a 4-digit PIN in order to protect the security of your account. When you later log on to
                           Consumer Reports Mobile, you will be asked to enter the mobile phone number and PIN you initially provided. If you have forgotten
                           your PIN and wish to log on, you can click on the "Forgot PIN?" link on the "Consumer Reports Mobile-only" user login page.
                           You will be asked to provide the mobile phone number you used when you initially registered for Consumer Reports Mobile. Upon
                           submitting that information, a text message containing your PIN will be sent promptly to that mobile phone number. If you
                           change your mobile phone number, you will be asked to create a new account by providing that mobile phone number and a 4-digit
                           PIN.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you have a print subscription that is managed online, you will need to provide us with your account number to make any
                           changes to your password or other subscriber information. Both online and print subscribers may also call our customer support
                           to retrieve forgotten account information or to otherwise make changes to their information. In that case, you will be asked
                           to provide your name or email address, as well as the street or post office address we have on record for you, prior to a
                           customer service representative providing or changing your user name or password.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is your responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your user name and password and to control access to and
                           use of your account. We urge you to keep your user name and password confidential and not disclose them to anyone. Be sure
                           to sign off when finished using our Sites, especially if you are using a shared or public computer. We will not be responsible
                           or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision, for example, a third party's unauthorized
                           access to your information.
                        </p>
                        <p>You may choose to send us emails. Information disclosed in emails may not be secure or encrypted and thus may be available
                           to others. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or confidential information in emails.
                        </p>
                        <p>IMPORTANT - Although we take these steps to protect your personal information, no method of transmitting or storing electronic
                           data is ever completely secure, therefore we cannot promise or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used
                           or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
