<span class="body">
<br>
1. Introduction<br>
Thank you for visiting BrainyQuote.com, a site designed to inform, inspire, educate and entertain users all around the globe. This Privacy Policy is written to better explain how we collect and use your information, and to cover our caboose in case you plan to sue us because you don't like how we use information, or you're a person who just doesn't like quotes. This Privacy Policy is a binding contract and you must agree to it to the same extent as our Terms of Service in order to use our services, including submitting quotes to our website.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="body">
2. Personal Information We Collect<br>
Good news! You don't have to give us any personal information when you use our website. You may, however, tell us your name and your life story (it's not that we're not interested, and we can't stop you), but please do not share your personal details when you submit a quote to us for consideration. We will not disclose any information that you provide to us except in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="body">
3. Non-Personal Information We Collect<br>
We may collect information about you that is not personal information. When you access our website and/or submit a quote, we may collect such things as your IP address, browser, operating system, referring URL, and other general information about our visitors. This information, on its own, cannot usually be used to identify you.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="body">
4. Use of Information<br>
We may use your information for a wide variety of purposes, including printing physical paper copies of it and turning it into an origami hat (kidding again). Specifically, though, we may let your non-personal information be shared with:
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="body">
* Our host, whose server logs collect the non-personal information described above.
<br><br>
* Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our websites. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google ad and content network privacy policy.</a>
<br><br>
* RadiumOne, which uses cookies to identify anonymous user interests on our websites. You may opt out of the RadiumOne cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.radiumone.com/about/opt.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RadiumOne Preference Manager</a>.
<br><br>
* AOL Advertising, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to identify anonymous user interests on our websites. Users may opt out of the use of the AOL Advertising cookie by visiting the <a href="http://advertising.aol.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AOL Advertising Preference Manager</a>.
<br><br>
* Quantcast, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to identify anonymous user interests on our websites. Users may opt out of the use of the Quantcast cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/opt-out" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quantcast Preference Manager</a>.
<br><br>
* comScore, Inc. (weird capitalization intentional - but that's how they spell it), which also identifies anonymous user interests on our websites via its Scorecard Research program. You may opt out of this cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scorecard Research Preference Manager</a>.
<br><br>
* Krux Digital, which uses cookies to identify anonymous user interests (starting to notice a pattern here?) on our websites. You may opt out of this cookie by visiting - wait for it - the <a href="http://www.kruxdigital.com/krux_privacy/consumer_choice/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Krux Digital Preference Manager</a>.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="body">
5. Cookies<br>
Cookies aren't just delicious; they also apparently have something to do with computers. We use cookies to save your preferences. We also use cookies to track ads and to share information with third parties as described above. Because of this, you should enable your cookies when you use our website. If you're new to the Internet, please don't try dunking your mouse in milk and eating it; this is the Number One complaint we get after users read our Privacy Policy.
</span>
<br><br>

<span class="big" style="color:#555555">Barbara Jordan</span><br><br>
</div>
<span class="body">
6. Third Party Websites<br>
We may link to third party websites from our own website. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, these third party websites or their use of your personal information. We recommend that, if you have a ridiculous amount of free time (and nothing better to do), you review their privacy policies and other agreements governing your use of their website. Once you do, you should report back to us in a detailed and meticulously proofread memorandum explaining all of these websites, so we may immediately put it to use under that corner of the table that is lower than the rest.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="body">
7. Third Party Access to Your Information<br>
We protect your information from being accessed by third parties using our state of the art laser defense system. Well, not really... we just wanted to use the word "lasers" in our Privacy Policy. In truth, we take adequate measures to protect your information. We may employ outside maintenance personnel or use a third party to host our material. Because of this, it is necessary that you permit us to give access to your information to third parties to the same extent that you authorize us to do so. For greater certainty, every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or hire as an intern for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="body">
8. Law Enforcement<br>
We may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, in bad faith, or in so-so faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. Chances are that if the police are looking into your activities on a quote website, you've really got issues, and we're probably going to hand over your information and tell your family and friends.

</div>
<span class="body">
9. Security of Information<br>
We may, but are not obligated to, secure our website with packs of hungry bunnies; we hope they don't eat your information. However, we make no representations as to the security or privacy of your information. It is in our interest to keep our website secure, but we recommend that you use anti-virus software, firewalls, and other precautions to protect yourself from security threats. (Be the third pig, not one of the first two.)
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="body">
10. California Online Privacy Protection Act<br>
We allow California users to use our website, and we fully comply with California's privacy laws. If you have any questions about your rights under this Privacy Policy, please contact us for more information.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="body">
11. Amendments<br>
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, and the amended version will be posted on our website in place of the old version. We will also include the date that the currently displayed Privacy Policy took effect to help you determine whether there have been any changes since you last used our website. Like our Terms of Service, you must visit this page each time you come to our website, and read and agree to it if the date it was last modified is more recent than the last time you agreed to the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the new Privacy Policy, you must immediately cease using our service.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="body">
12. Contact<br>
Any inquiries about your rights under this Privacy Policy, or any other matters regarding your privacy, can be sent or directed to
