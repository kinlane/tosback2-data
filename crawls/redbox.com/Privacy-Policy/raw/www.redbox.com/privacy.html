<p><a id="cookies" name="cookies"></a><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong>. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit a Site or  otherwise access our online content. Cookies may be used for many purposes,  including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and  tracking your visits to our web pages. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on  a Device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by  you to your Device.&nbsp; Flash cookies may be  used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash  feature and remembering your preferences.

<p><a id="anchor11" name="anchor11"></a><strong>When You Agree to Receive  Information From Third Parties or Otherwise  Request That We Share Your Information</strong></p>
<p>You may be presented with an opportunity to receive  information and/or marketing offers from one or more third parties. If you  agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal  Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be  subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party. We are not  responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties and,  therefore, you should review the privacy policies and practices of third  parties prior to agreeing to share your information. If you later decide that  you no longer want to receive communication from a third party, you will need  to contact that third party directly.</p>
<p>You  also may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or third  party application, that we share information about you with a third party and  we will typically do so under those circumstances.&nbsp; For example, we may share information with  third parties regarding a purchase you make at Redbox in order for you to receive  an online credit or points or to be able to play an interactive game on a third  party web site, interactive feature or application.</p>
