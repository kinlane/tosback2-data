  Sweepstakes</strong></a>:&nbsp; The Nickelodeon Sites may offer online contests and sweepstakes.
  To enter these contests and sweepstakes, you may be required to provide your first name
  and email address and/or additional information required for the management of the
  contest or sweepstakes.&nbsp; On sites that either are directed to children under 13 or
  where we have actual knowledge that a user is a child under 13, we may collect the
  child&#8217;s e-mail address to enter the child in the contest or sweepstakes, store
  such child&#8217;s email address for the duration of the sweepstakes, and use it for
  notification if he or she is the winner. For certain contests or sweepstakes on such
  sites, we may ask for the email address of the child's parent or guardian to inform the
  parent or guardian of his or her child's entry and give the parent or guardian the
  option to have the child's entry deleted.</p>

  <p class="justify" style="text-indent:4em"><a class="no-hover" id="I_F"><strong>F.&nbsp;
  Electronic Postcards and Messages</strong></a>: Some Nickelodeon Sites provide visitors the
  opportunity to send electronic postcards and &#8220;wish lists&#8221; of items they
  want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the visitor&#8217;s behalf,
  email messages to family and/or friends. To do so, visitors must provide the email
  address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. Email
  addresses provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the requested
  postcard or email message and are deleted from our system once the postcard or message
  is sent.&nbsp; In some cases, we may offer visitors an incentive (<em>e.g.</em>, points
  to be used in an online game) for referring information about products to the visitor's
  family or friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such cases, we will comply with all applicable legal
  requirements. Please note that this feature may not be available to visitors in certain

  regarding emails at any time through the unsubscribe link in the newsletters or, for
  certain Nickelodeon Sites, by logging into and changing the preferences for their
  account.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="justify">When visitors to
  Nickelodeon Sites that either are directed to children under 13 or have actual
  knowledge that a user is a child under 13 years old ask to receive our email
  newsletter(s), they&nbsp;will be asked to provide their first name, email address and
  the email address of their parent/guardian. We will send the child's parent/guardian a
  notification email informing them of the child's request to receive by email the
  newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent/guardian the option to have his or
  her child's information removed from our newsletter database. The link to remove the
  child&#8217;s information will expire approximately 48 hours from the time it is sent,
  but at any time after receiving this notification email, the child's parent/guardian
  may request that we stop sending the child the newsletter(s) by following the
  "unsubscribe" instructions found at the end of any of the newsletter emails.&nbsp;
  Parents/guardians may at any time review any personally identifiable information
  collected online about their child. See section V (B) below. When a child provides a
  parent's/guardian's email address when signing up for newsletter(s), that email address
  is used to send the notification email message and is subsequently deleted from our
  system.</p>

  Sites that either are directed to children under 13 or have actual knowledge that a
  user is a child under 13 years old, we either will obtain the consent of the
  child&#8217;s parent before allowing the child to use these interactive features and
  services or will use reasonable technical measures to delete all or virtually all
  personal information from a child&#8217;s postings before they are made public and also
