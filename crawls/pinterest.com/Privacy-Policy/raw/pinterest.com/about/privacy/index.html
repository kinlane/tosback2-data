                <p>Thank you for using Pinterest! We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have regarding your information. Because we're an Internet company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we've tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. We welcome your <a target="_blank" href="https://support.pinterest.com/anonymous_requests/new">questions and comments</a> on this policy.</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
                <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>We collect information in two ways:</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
                <h4>1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.</h4>
              
              
              
                <p>When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, profile photo, pins, comments, likes, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. If you're using Pinterest on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data.</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to Pinterest, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
                <h4>2. We get technical information when you use our products.</h4>
              
              
              
                <p>These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use our products, and here are some of the types of information we collect in this way.</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>Log Data. When you use Pinterest, our servers automatically record information about your interaction with our products ("log data"), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you use it to access Pinterest. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to Pinterest, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used Pinterest.</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Pinterest account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Pinterest settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest.</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using Pinterest on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
                <h3>How do we use the information we collect?</h3>
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>We use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better, develop new products, and protect Pinterest and our users. For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is better.</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>We also use the information we collect to offer you customized content -- including helping you discover pins or boards you might like or provide you with tailored advertising. For example, if you've indicated that you're interested in cooking, we may suggest food-related pins, boards, or people.</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>We also use the information we collect to:</p>
              
              
              
                <ul class="hazBullet">
                  
                    <li>send you updates (such as when certain activity, like repins or comments, happens on Pinterest), newsletters, marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you. For example, depending on your email notification settings, we may send you weekly updates that include pins you may like. You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating your account settings (or through other settings we may provide).</li>
                  
                    <li>Respond to your questions or comments.</li>
                  
                </ul>
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>The information we collect may be "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or "non-personally identifiable" (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever Pinterest does business, including countries outside your own.</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
                <h3>What choices do you have about your information?</h3>
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices over your information. If you have a Pinterest account, many of the choices you have on Pinterest are built directly in to the product or your account settings. For example, you can:</p>
              
              
              
                <ul class="hazBullet">
                  
                    <li>Access and change information in your <a target="_blank" href="http://pinterest.com/me/">profile page</a> at any time, and choose whether your profile page is available to search engines;</li>
                  
                    <li>Link or unlink your Pinterest account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your activity on Pinterest to that service.</li>
                  
                    <li>Create or be added to a secret board. Secret boards are visible to you and other participants in the board, and any participant may choose to make the contents of the board available to anyone else. For example, another participant may invite someone else to the board, make the board available to an app they use to view Pinterest, or even just take an image from the board and email it to their friends. For more information about secret boards, please visit our <a target="_blank" href="http://support.pinterest.com/">Help Center</a>.</li>
                  
                    <li>Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we'll deactivate it and remove your pins and boards from Pinterest. We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam).</li>
                  
                </ul>
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>In addition to the examples above, we offer other choices that you can learn more about in our <a target="_blank" href="http://support.pinterest.com/">Help Center</a>.</p>
              
              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Pinterest. For example:</p>
              
              
              
                <ul class="hazBullet">
                  
                    <li>The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage;</li>
                  
                    <li>Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us.</li>
                  
                </ul>
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider.</p>
