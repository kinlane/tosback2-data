	            </p>
	            <p>
	                <b>By accessing or using the Service, you are indicating that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms"), which form a legal agreement between you and AVOS.</b> These Terms govern your access to and use of the Service and all Service Content (defined below).  If there is a conflict between these Terms and the terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Service or certain content, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence for your use of or access to that specific area. If you accept or agree to these Terms on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
	            </p>
	            <h3>The Basics</h3>
	            <p>
	                Our goal is to provide a valuable and enjoyable service through which users can share and discover the "tastiest" web content and have fun doing so.  Please read all of these Terms, and the <a href="http://delicious.com/privacy">Delicious Privacy Policy</a>, which forms part of these Terms and describes our collection and use of information you provide to us.
	            </p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>
	                    <b>What's yours is yours.</b> You grant us certain rights in your Member Content (e.g., to share your "public" content with the world!), but we don't claim any ownership rights in your Member Content.
	                </li>
	                <li>
	                    <b>Think about what you post and where.</b> Your Member Content (e.g., what you post to the Service) will be publicly viewable by others unless you mark it "private" (for bookmarks) or choose not to publish it (for stacks).  Please see our Privacy Policy which contains further details.
	                </li>
	            </ul>
	            <p>
	                <b>Please Note</b>: If you were a registered user of Delicious prior to the completion of the transition period, all information that you designated as "private" (including your first and last name and private bookmarks) will remain private after the transition is completed. See the <a href="http://delicious.com/privacy">Delicious Privacy Policy</a> and the <a href="http://delicious.com/help">Delicious FAQs</a> for further information regarding the transition.

You understand and agree that the Service and Service Content are provided to you on an "AS-IS" and "AS-AVAILABLE" basis. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, AVOS EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. We make no warranty (i) that the Service or Service Content will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis; or (ii) regarding the quality of any products, services or content or the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any Service Content obtained through the Service.

	            <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
	            <p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER AVOS NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICE OR SERVICE CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE; AND (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AVOS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
	            <p>IN NO EVENT WILL AVOS' AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR SERVICE CONTENT EXCEED FIFTY DOLLARS ($50).

	            <p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between AVOS and you regarding the Service and Service Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between AVOS and you regarding the Service and Service Content.</p>
	            <h3>Assignment</h3>
	            <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without AVOS' prior written consent.  Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.  AVOS may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction.  Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>

	            <h3>General</h3>
	            <p>The failure of AVOS to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.  The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of AVOS.  Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
