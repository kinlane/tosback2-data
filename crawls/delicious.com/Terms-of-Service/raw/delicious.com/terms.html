        	<h2>Delicious Terms of Service</h2>
        	<div class="subheading">Last Updated: November 8, 2012</div>
        	<div class="leftColumn contentBox">
	            <h3>Welcome to Delicious!</h3>
	            <p>
                        AVOS Systems, Inc. provides Delicious – the service that enables users to collect and discover web content through our website located at <a href="http://delicious.com/www.delicious.com">www.delicious.com</a> and by using related applications and the Delicious bookmarklet extension for your internet browser.  For simplicity, we’ll refer to any or all of this as the “Service”.
	            </p>
	            <p>
                        When you access or use the Service, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions (“Terms”) and acknowledge that they are a binding legal agreement between you and AVOS. 
	            </p>
                    <p>
                        By accessing or using the Service on behalf of an organization, like a company, you are also agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization and saying that you are authorized to do that on behalf of your organization.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Basics</h4>
 
                    <p>
                        Our goal is to provide a valuable and enjoyable service through which users can share and discover the “tastiest” web content.  Please read all of these Terms, and the Delicious Privacy Policy to be sure you understand how it all works.  Here are a few basic principles (more details on these are further down):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                         <li><u>What’s yours is yours and vice versa.</u>When you add content to the service you are NOT giving us ownership of what you added.  Likewise, we are not giving you ownership of anything belonging to AVOS.  You are giving us certain rights to use things you add to the Service as part of our operation of the Service and we are giving you the right to use the Service.</li>
                         <li><u>Content you put on the Service may be public so consider carefully what you add and how you add it.</u>  The Delicious Privacy Policy gives you full details on what is public and what is private.</li>
                         <li><u>Be good and play nicely.</u> The Service is only provided for lawful purposes and not for engaging in or promoting illegal activity.  Also, don’t do things that would harm the Service or make it less enjoyable for others.</li>
                    </ul>
	            <h4>Who Can Use Delicious?</h4>
	            <p>
                        The Service is intended solely for persons who are 13 or older. If you are not 13 or older, do not use the Service.  If you use or access the Service you are telling us that you are 13 or older. You may use the Service only as allowed by these Terms and all applicable laws. If something you want to do on the Service violates the Terms or the law, don’t do it.
	            </p>

                    <h4>Can I connect the Service to my account on a social network like Twitter, Instagram or Facebook?</h4>
                    <p>
                         Yes!  We have enabled linking your Delicious account to other social networks and will be adding more over time.  When you choose to create an account on the Service you will have the opportunity to register with and/or link the Service to certain other services on which you are a member, things like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.  You may also choose to link to these services after creating your account.  You do NOT need to register via another site or connect the Service to your other accounts, but if you do please be aware that you are authorizing us to access your account information on those other sites on your behalf.  See the Delicious Privacy Policy for more details.
                    </p>


                    <h4>What happens when I add something to the Service?</h4>
                    <p>
                         We’ll use the term, “User Content” to mean anything and everything a user adds to the Service.  The most common thing users will add are links they save, information about those links like tags or titles, and notes they add to those links.  This information may be publicly available depending on the user’s privacy selections.  See the Delicious Privacy Policy for more details.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Your User Content is yours and User Content added by others is theirs.  By adding something to the Service you are not giving AVOS or anyone else ownership of that User Content.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         When you put User Content on the Service, you do give us (and our service providers, partners and other users) free and unlimited rights to use your User Content as part of the Service including as the Service may evolve in the future.   This means we can use, including copying, modifying etc…, what you put on the Service as part running the Service worldwide and including things like enabling it on different devices and platforms.  For example, this license allows us to make your public links and related information available to others as part of their use of the Service.  This also means that other users of the Service can use your publicly available content as part of their use of the Service.
                    </p>

                    <h4>You are responsible for what you do on the Service.</h4>
                    <p>
                         You are responsible for your use of the Service and all of your User Content, we are not responsible or liable for any use of your User Content. Depending on your privacy settings, your User Content may be used by us, other users, and our partners.  If you don’t have the right to submit your User Content for such use, it may subject you to liability. When you add content to the Service you are representing that you have all the necessary rights to do so and to enable others to use the content as described in these Terms.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Can I remove content I add to the Service?</h4>
                    <p>
                          Yes, you may remove your User Content from the Service at any time by specifically marking it for deletion or terminating your Account.  If you choose to remove your User Content or to terminate your Account, your User Content will be removed from our systems in a commercially reasonable amount time (e.g., time enough to allow our services to update), provided, however, we may retain an archived copy as required by law. In addition, in certain instances, copies of your User Content may continue to exist in published or recorded form when it has been retransmitted, redistributed, or otherwise licensed to others as contemplated in these Terms. For instance, once an RSS feed has been downloaded we do not have the ability to change that download; so, if you delete something after that RSS feed has been downloaded what you deleted will not be deleted from the downloaded copy.  Likewise, to the extent that search engines or others archive pages it’s possible your content will remain available through those search engines even though it’s not available on the live version of our site (or even in any cached versions we maintain).
                    </p>

                    <h4>Should I back-up my content?</h4>
                    <p>
                          Yes, and AVOS provides registered users with simple export options to do this.  While we do not anticipate an event where a user’s information would be lost, we cannot guarantee it will never happen.  Therefore, it’s your responsibility to back-up your User Content. You agree that AVOS is not responsible or liable for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit any User Content.  Users whose accounts have been terminated by AVOS as allowed in these Terms will need to contact AVOS directly if they wish to obtain a copy of the User Content they added. AVOS will consider such requests on a case by case basis and is under no obligation to grant such request or provide such information.
                    </p>

                    <h4>We are not Big Brother.</h4>
                    <p>
                        AVOS has no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the Service or to review or edit any User Content you choose to add and we do not do so as part of our normal operations; however, AVOS has the right to do these things for the purpose of operating the Service, to ensure your compliance with these Terms and applicable laws.  AVOS reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any content on the Service that AVOS, it its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Service.
                    </p>

                    <h4>We are also not your Mother, but we do want you to be careful when crossing the Internet.</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Service contains links to other websites that our users have shared.  If you choose to click on a link and go to another site you may be exposed to content that is offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate.  If you aren’t sure a site is safe and inoffensive to you, don’t click on the link.  If you click a link and something bad happens when you visit another site we are not responsible or liable in any way.  We’re not responsible for the content of other sites and we’re not responsible for links users share on the Service.  Just because a user has shared a link does not mean it’s safe and the fact that the link is on the Service does not mean we have checked it, endorsed it or otherwise determined its ok for you to visit, we have not.  You assume all risk from visiting sites linked to on the Service.  
                    </p>

                    <h4>Copyrights and Trademarks: Don’t Infringe Other People’s Rights!</h4>
                    <p>
                         AVOS respects copyright and trademark laws and expects its users to do the same.  AVOS has adopted and implemented a policy that tells copyright owners how to notify us if they believe content on the Service infringes their rights.  Please see the Delicious Copyright Policy for further information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         We have the right to and will terminate users’ accounts if they repeatedly infringe or are believed to be repeatedly infringing other people’s rights.  We also reserve the right to require a user to change their username for any reason including infringement of someone’s rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         By the way, copyright and trademark laws also protect the Service and AVOS exclusively owns all rights to the Service except as expressly provided in these Terms.  All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of AVOS used herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of AVOS. Any other trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective parties.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What Not To Do</h4>
                    <p>
                         Most of this should be pretty obvious, but here’s a list just to make sure people are clear on some of the details of what it’s not ok to do on the Service:
                    </p>

                    <h4><u>DO NOT:</u></h4>
                    <ul>

                       <li>Use the Service for an unlawful purpose or for promotion of illegal activities;</li>
                       <li>Impersonate others through the Service in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse or deceive others;</li>

                       <li>Attempt to access or search the Service or any content on the service or download any content from the Service through the use of any engine, software, tool, agent, device or mechanism (including spiders, robots, crawlers, data mining tools or the like) other than the software and/or search agents provided by AVOS or other generally available third party web browsers;</li>
                       <li>Send any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, email, junk mail, spam, chain letters or other form of solicitation;</li>
                       <li>Forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or newsgroup posting, or in any way use the Service to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information;</li>
                       <li>Interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, intentionally linking to malicious content, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing the Service;</li>
                       <li>Collect or store any personally identifiable information from the Service from other users of the Service without their express permission; or</li>
                       <li>Encourage or enable any other individual to do any of the foregoing.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>When it’s Over</h4>

                    <p>
                        If you violate any of these Terms, your permission to use the Service may be suspended or permanently revoked.   We reserve the right to suspend, disable or terminate your Account, in our sole discretion and without prior notice to you, with or without cause. You may cancel your Account at any time via the “Settings” section of your Account.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Got Feedback?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Any feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Service that you submit to AVOS (“<b>Feedback</b>”) will be the sole and exclusive property of AVOS and by submitting such Feedback you irrevocably assign to AVOS and agree to irrevocably assign to AVOS all of your rights in all such Feedback, including all related intellectual property rights.  Your submission of any Feedback to AVOS is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such Feedback as we choose and without any obligation to you.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Delicious Bookmarklet</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you choose to install the Delicious Bookmarklet the following further terms and conditions also apply in addition to those above and below this “Delicious Bookmarklet” section:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <u>Delicious Bookmarklet License.</u> Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of these Terms, AVOS grants you a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to install and use the executable form of the Delicious Bookmarklet, without modification.

                    <h4>The Service is Available “AS-IS”</h4>

                    <p>
                        Your access to and use of the Service and any content available on or through the Service is at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Service and content available on or through the Service are provided to you on an “AS-IS” and “AS-AVAILABLE” basis. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, AVOS EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. We make no warranty (i) that the Service or any content available on or through the Service will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis; or (ii) regarding the quality of any products, services or content or the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any content obtained through the Service.

                    </p>

                    <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
                    <p>
                         YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER AVOS NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICE WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM OR THROUGH THE SERVICE; AND (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AVOS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         IN NO EVENT WILL AVOS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGHT THE SERVICE EXCEED FIFTY DOLLARS ($50). THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN AVOS AND YOU.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
                    <p>
                        These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, including any claims arising from or related to the use of the Service or Service Content, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
                    </p>

                    <h4>We may make Modifications or Changes</h4>
                    <p>
                         AVOS may, its sole discretion, choose to modify, discontinue or terminate the Service, at any time and without prior notice.  AVOS may also choose to modify the Terms.  If we choose to modify the Terms, we’ll post them and give you a chance to provide feedback before they become effective except in extraordinary circumstances where we think it’s important for them to become effective as soon as they are posted in which case we’ll make that clear.  Once they become effective your continued use of the Service will mean you agree to be bound by the new terms.  If you don’t agree then you need to stop using the Service.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Entire Agreement</h4>
                    <p>
                         These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between AVOS and you regarding the Service and Service Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between AVOS and you regarding the Service and Service Content.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Assignment</h4>
                    <p>
                         You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without AVOS’ prior written consent.  Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.  AVOS may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction.  Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
                    </p> 

                    <h4>Notices</h4>
                    <p>
                          Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by AVOS (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide); or (ii) by posting on the Site or via the Service.  For notices made by e-mail or posting, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted or posted, whichever is earlier.
                    </p>

                    <h4>General</h4>
                    <p>
                          The failure of AVOS to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.  The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of AVOS.  Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
                    </p>
