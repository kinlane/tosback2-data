<h3>What types of information do we collect?</h3>
<br />

This information includes: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited before clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); (d) your browser language; and (e) the data in any undeleted &quot;cookies&quot; that your browser previously accepted from us (see &quot;<a href="privacy.shtml.html#3">How are cookies used on the Site?</a>&quot; below). Additionally, when you enter a search query using the Site or Services, we will receive the query text and process it, together with the above data, to return a search results page to you. If you have modified your browser settings so that address-bar search queries and erroneous domain name system (DNS) requests are submitted to us, we may also receive any search query or misspelled URL that you enter into your browser's address bar. </p>
<br />
<p>Beginning with search queries received on or before July 1, 2009, we disassociate your query text data from your IP address and your unique cookie ID (see &quot;<a href="privacy.shtml.html#3">How are cookies used on the Sites?</a>&quot; below) after a period of 18 months, except in limited circumstances, such as requests to retain the information by law enforcement.</p>
<br />
