<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><a id="3" name="3"></a>What are cookies and do we use them?</span></p>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a website that is saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser. It holds information a site may need to interact with you and personalize your experience. At bloomingdales.com, we use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Once you exit your browser, they go away. We use session cookies to maintain information we need to have in order for you to shop at bloomingdales.com. For example, the Session ID cookie that we ask your browser to hold retains the ID for your shopping bag. Without the Session ID cookie, you can't add merchandise to your bag and carry it to Checkout.<br /></p>
<p>Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit; they do not go away when you exit your browser. At bloomingdales.com, we use persistent cookies to give you a more personalized shopping experience and to help you navigate our store more efficiently. We will use your information to enhance your site experience. However, you can use our site without accepting a persistent cookie. To do so, you should set your browser options to reject persistent cookies. Alternatively, you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, which gives you the opportunity to decide whether you want to accept it or not. In many instances, the Help button on your browser toolbar will tell you how you can take these steps.<br /></p>
<p>Cookies can be used by a Web site to recognize you, but that does not necessarily mean any personal information is stored in the cookies. At bloomingdales.com, we store no personal information about you in the cookies. Anything you choose to tell us about yourself (such as your address and e-mail address) is stored safely and separately on our secured servers, and you need to provide a password to access it.<br /></p>
<p>We also use cookies to look at how groups, rather than individuals, use our Web site. In our physical stores, we can observe which aisles and departments are most heavily trafficked and determine what displays or sales are the most successful. Then, we can identify ways to improve the customer experience. On the Web, cookies help us develop a similar understanding so that we can continue to improve the arrangement, product offerings, and merchandise placement you see at bloomingdales.com.<br /></p>
<p>If you would like to opt out of receiving any cookies from bloomingdales.com, please use the help function in your Web browser to restrict bloomingdales.com cookies. Lastly, if your existing cookie expires or you clear your cookies for any reason, you will need to follow the above steps again to opt out of any new cookies.<br /></p>
<p>Bloomingdales.com uses single pixel images, sometimes called Web beacons or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These files are provided by our ad management and e-mail service partners, and enable them to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with these partners. The information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, postal address, telephone number, or email address. Get more information about or opt out of our third-party ad server.</p>

<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><a id="4" name="4"></a>Targeted advertising<br /></span><br />
We also use a third-party advertising network (Dotomi) to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a single pixel image. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. We do not provide Dotomi with your name, phone number, postal address, email address, or any other personally identifying information about you.

<br />
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><a id="5" name="5"></a>How do we use your information?<br /></span><br />
We may use your information in a number of ways, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to serve you better, we may combine the information you provide us online and in our stores. We use that information to improve your overall Bloomingdale's experience.<br /></li>
<li>To improve the content on our Web site; for example, we may use cookies to find out which parts of our site or which of our products are visited most often.<br /></li>
<li>To enhance your online shopping experience; for example, we may use it to recognize you and welcome you to the site.<br /></li>
<li>For marketing and promotional purposes, we send out e-mails and direct mail to our customers about products or events that we think may be of interest to them. We also may send you offers for discounts or promotions, new arrivals or new site features. If you do not wish to receive e-mail from us, click the link to unsubscribe in the next e-mail update you receive from us. Or, if you are registered with bloomingdales.com you can change your preferences in your Profile. Sign in to view your Profile, then uncheck the box next to e-mail updates and click Submit.</li>

<br />
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><a id="6" name="6"></a>Do we share your information?</span><br />
<br />
The information gathered will be shared with the Macy's, Inc. family of companies. We also may share this information with other third parties, including companies with which we have a relationship. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bloomingdales.com may enter into a "co-branding" relationship with another Web site that offers you products or services (e.g., flowers). In those cases, you may link from bloomingdales.com to another site to purchase the item. In that case, both bloomingdales.com and the other Web site may receive your information.<br /></li>
<li>Bloomingdales.com may team with a partner to conduct a sweepstakes or other event (e.g., a live Web chat). In those cases, each of the participating Web sites may collect or receive personal information from you.<br /></li>
<li>For some of our products, bloomingdales.com may provide you with a link to the supplier of that product so that you may get further information. If you visit the supplier's site, the supplier may collect or receive information about you according to its stated policy.<br /></li>
<li>Bloomingdales.com may use an outside company to place its advertising banners or links on other sites. In certain cases, the advertiser may collect information on people who click on the banner or link.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most of the above situations, these third parties will receive your information because you will be visiting their Web sites or using their links and, in doing so, you may provide information directly to them. You therefore should refer to their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information and what kinds of choices you have.<br />
<br />
Bloomingdale's also may share your personal information with outside companies that perform services for Bloomingdale's. For example, we may retain an outside company to manage a database containing certain customer information or to create and distribute an e-mail offering. In those situations, the outside party is performing work for Bloomingdale's, and Bloomingdale’s includes language in its contracts stating that your information is to be used only to provide the services requested by Bloomingdale's, and not for other purposes.<br />
<br />
Notwithstanding any other provision of this policy, Bloomingdale's may share any information we possess, subject to applicable legal requirements, when we believe it is necessary to prevent or investigate fraud, comply with the law or to otherwise protect our interests or property. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers or government agencies in connection with issues related to fraud or government subpoenas and warrants.<br />
<br />
In the event that some or all of the business assets of Bloomingdale's are sold or transferred, we generally would transfer the corresponding information about our customers.<br />
<br />
Finally, Bloomingdale's may share your personal information with unrelated outside companies so that they can directly market their products or services to you if we feel that a company offers products or services that may be of interest to you. We also may provide you with the opportunity to sign-up on our Web site to receive such offers.<br />

<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><a id="7" name="7"></a>What choices do you have regarding the use of your information?<br /></span><br />
We provide you with a number of choices regarding our handling of your personal information online and offline.<br />
<br />
Opting out of e-mail<br />
<br />
If you do not want to receive e-mail from bloomingdales.com, please follow the steps outlined below to submit an opt-out request:</p>
<ul>

<li>To unsubscribe offline, you may contact us by phone at 1-888-529-2254, or write to:</li>
</ul>
<p>BLOOMINGDALE'S CUSTOMER SERVICE<br />
P.O. Box 8215<br />
Mason, OH 45040<br />
<br />
If you shop at our Bloomingdale's stores and wish to be removed from the list of customers who receive direct mail or from our telemarketing lists, please either: (i) write to Bloomingdale's Customer Service, P.O. Box 8215, Mason, OH 45040, or (ii) call Customer Service toll-free at 1-888-529-2254.<br />
<br />
If you choose to write us, please include your name, address, phone number and the last four digits of your Bloomingdale's credit card account number (if you have one), and state one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>"NO MAIL OFFERS" (if you do not want to receive offers by mail).<br /></li>
<li>"NO PHONE OFFERS" (if you do not want to receive offers by phone).<br /></li>
<li>"NO PHONE OR MAIL OFFERS" (if you do not want to receive either).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering (sometimes 3-4 months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified marketing purposes. We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request.<br />
<br />
Opting out of third-party sharing<br />
<br />
You also may use the address and phone number above to request that we not disclose your personal information to unrelated third parties for marketing purposes.

<br />
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><a id="8" name="8"></a>Is your information secure?</span><br />
<br />
Bloomingdales.com has put in place various procedural, technical and administrative measures to try to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.<br />
<br />
To the extent customer information is maintained, it is located on a secured server behind a firewall; it is not directly connected to the Internet. The firewall meets recognized industry standards.<br />
<br />
We designed bloomingdales.com to accept orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology; for example, versions 5.01 or higher of Internet Explorer, versions 0.8 or higher of Firefox and versions 1.2 or higher of Safari. SSL is encryption technology that provides security while information is being transmitted over the Internet.<br />
<br />
While we implement the above security measures on this site, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.<br />

<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><a id="10" name="10"></a>What about information about children?</span><br />
<br />
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000, and imposes certain requirements on Web sites directed toward children under 13 that collect information on those children, or on Web sites that know they are collecting information on children under the age of 13. Bloomingdales.com's current policy is not to collect personal information on any person under 13. For this reason, our online sweepstakes are restricted to entrants who, at a minimum, are at least 13.<br />

<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><a id="11" name="11"></a>International customer privacy<br /></span><br />
To sell and fulfill online purchases that customers choose to ship internationally, bloomingdales.com partners with FiftyOne, Inc. (“FiftyOne”). FiftyOne will carefully process your personal information, with at least the same level of privacy protection set forth in the U.S. - EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and the U.S. -&#160;Swiss Harbor Privacy Principles established by the U.S. Department of Commerce. FiftyOne also agrees not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for executing international shipping orders.<br />
<br />
When you identify your bloomingdales.com order as being shipped internationally, you will be redirected to a checkout page hosted by FiftyOne. On the checkout page you will be required to submit personal information to FiftyOne to complete your order. Once you place your order, you will be prompted to confirm whether you would like to receive future marketing communication from bloomingdales.com.<br />
<br />
FiftyOne will notify bloomingdales.com of the approval of your order, and bloomingdales.com will then ship approved orders to FiftyOne. Simultaneously, FiftyOne will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you. In this process, FiftyOne makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. When ordering a product, you will be presented with FiftyOne’s terms and conditions to which you must agree in order to receive the product(s) you ordered.<br />
<br />
Once you have agreed that FiftyOne may share your data collected from their page with bloomingdales.com, that data is protected by this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.<br />
<br />
We adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. We have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union that our processing of personal data is in compliance with these principles and we perform periodic self-assessments to verify ongoing compliance.<br />
<br />
Bloomingdales.com is committed to resolving any customer concerns regarding their privacy. If a customer feels that their privacy may have been violated, based on the Safe Harbor Principles, bloomingdales.com will attempt to directly resolve the complaint. Any complaints that are still unresolved after these direct efforts will be settled by arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its applicable commercial rules.<br />
