<h1>Marquee Media Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last modified: August 23, 2011</p>
<p>
  Your privacy is critically important to us. Marquee Media has a few
  fundamental principles:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  </li>
  <li>
    We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply
    with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  </li>
  <li>
    We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for
    the on-going operation of one of our services.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>
  Like most website operators, Marquee Media collects non-personally-
  identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers
  typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
  referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Marquee
  Media’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to
  better understand how Marquee Media’s visitors use its website.
</p>
<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>
  Certain visitors to Marquee Media’s websites choose to interact with
  Marquee Media in ways that require Marquee Media to gather personally-
  identifying information. The amount and type of information that Marquee
  Media gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
  ask visitors who submit a contact request to provide a name and email
  address. Those who engage in transactions with Marquee Media – by
  purchasing our advertising services, for example – are asked to provide
  additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial
  information required to process those transactions. In each case, Marquee
  Media collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
  appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with
  Marquee Media. Marquee Media does not disclose personally-identifying
  information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse
  to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may
  prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
</p>
<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>
  Marquee Media discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-
  identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and
  affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order
  to process it on Marquee Media’s behalf or to provide services available
  at Marquee Media’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it
  to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
  organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
  Marquee Media’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information
  to them. Marquee Media will not rent or sell potentially personally-
  identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than
  to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described
  above, Marquee Media discloses potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
  order or other governmental request, or when Marquee Media believes in
  good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
  or rights of Marquee Media, third parties or the public at large. If you
  are a registered user of an Marquee Media website and have supplied your
  email address, Marquee Media may occasionally send you an email to tell
  you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
  with what’s going on with Marquee Media and our products. If you send us a
  request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
  mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
  clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
  Marquee Media takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against
  the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
  A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
  computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time
  the visitor returns. Marquee Media uses cookies to help Marquee Media
  identify and track visitors, their usage of Marquee Media website, and
  their website access preferences. Marquee Media visitors who do not wish
  to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to
  refuse cookies before using Marquee Media’s websites, with the drawback
  that certain features of Marquee Media’s websites may not function
  properly without the aid of cookies.
</p>
<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
<p>
  If Marquee Media, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in
  the unlikely event that Marquee Media goes out of business or enters
  bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
  transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
  transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Marquee Media may continue
  to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>
  Although most changes are likely to be minor, Marquee Media may change its
  Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Marquee Media’s sole discretion.
  Marquee Media encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any
  changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any
  change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such
  change.
