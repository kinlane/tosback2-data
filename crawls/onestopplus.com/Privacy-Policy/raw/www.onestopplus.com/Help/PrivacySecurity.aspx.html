        OSP HEADER 2011 - READ ME

        Important change: because of the new tabs, more than one tab can be active simultaneously.
        Highlighting active categories in HeaderInit.js must be done now through class, not id.
        New format for tabs: inactive: <a class="tab-00"...>; active: <a class="tab-00-active"...>.
        See 1024_main.css and HeaderInit.js (or contact UI) for more info on styling tabbed nav.

        In addition, the search function has changed. Default text is now handled by HeaderInit.js
        to prevent blur/focus behaviors from breaking if the text changes. Set default text below.
    -->

    <script type="text/javascript">
        // default text for the search box - don't delete this variable!

<h3 class="h3-PS">Terms and Conditions for International Orders</h3>
        <p class="p-PS">When you place an order for delivery outside the United States, the Redcats USA <a href="PrivacySecurity.aspx.html#top">Privacy Policy</a> and Terms of Use posted on our website apply to you <strong>AS MODIFIED</strong> by these Terms and Conditions.</p>

        

<p class="p-PS"><strong>Placing an Order</strong><br />Redcats USA gladly accepts orders from all around the globe and can ship eligible products to certain countries so long as <strong>the billing address and &quot;ship to&quot; address are the same.</strong>  Available product lines, shipping rates and fees may vary depending on the delivery address for your order.<br /><br />
        You will be notified at checkout if certain items must be removed due to weight, size (too large to ship in one package) or import/export laws and regulations.  You must remove those items from your Shopping Bag before you can proceed to checkout. <br /><br />Your order will be completed by our shipping partner, I-PARCEL, who will convert our prices into your preferred currency, collect your payment information and estimate customs fees and import duties based on the country where your order will be delivered (the &quot;destination country&quot;).  For international orders, your credit card information is only collected by I-PARCEL and is not shared with or collected by Redcats USA.  See the Privacy Policy of <a href="http://www.i-parcel.com/safeharbor.aspx" target="_blank">I-PARCEL.</a>  If required by the destination country, I-PARCEL or its agent may request additional personal identifying information that must be provided to complete the delivery.  Such information will only be used for the purpose of processing your order.  If you do not agree to these terms and do not provide the information, your order cannot be processed.<br /><br />Once your order is complete, we will ship your order to I-PARCEL&lsquo;s New Jersey location, and then I-PARCEL will ship the order to you.  If we are not able to deliver your order, we will attempt to notify you of the problem using the email address you provided during checkout to notify you that your package has been deemed &quot;undeliverable&quot;.  Please be sure your address and email information is correct during checkout.  In the event that we cannot deliver your order (for example, an incomplete or wrong address) your order will be cancelled and we will refund the price of items you ordered.  Shipping, handling and import fees and duties will not be refunded.</p>
       
        <p class="p-PS"><strong>Customer Service</strong><br />Email is the easiest way for our international customers to reach us.  During our normal <a href="http://www.onestopplus.com/Help/Help.aspx" target="_blank">business hours</a> you can reach customer service representatives who speak English and Spanish by calling +1 915 225 4970.  Other languages are not supported at this time.</p>

        
        <p class="p-PS"><strong>Sizes</strong><br />International size charts are developed based on industry standards and subject to some variability within different garment types.</p>
       <p class="p-PS"><strong>Import Duties, Customs Fees and Taxes</strong><br />
Your packages may be subject to customs fees and import duties imposed by the country where your package will be delivered (the &quot;destination country&quot;).  These charges are always your responsibility. There is no free shipping and handling on international orders, even if such a promotion is available for orders inside the United States.</p>
        <p class="p-PS">When you place an order for international delivery, you are the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country.  By placing your order, you authorize I-PARCEL, its employees and agents, to act as your agent with the customs and tax authorities in the destination country, to clear your merchandise, to process and remit your actual import fees for the items ordered.  Even if you are ordering something you intend to give as a gift, by ordering, you authorize our shipping partner to act on behalf of the person who will receive the package, and the order must be shipped to your address</p>
        <p class="p-PS">By placing your order you agree to allow I-PARCEL to collect estimated duties for the applicable items in your order.  These funds will be used, on your behalf, to reimburse I-PARCEL&lsquo;s carriers and agents for the import fees that they must pay on your behalf to the appropriate authorities of the destination country.  It is possible that Customs clearance procedures can cause a shipment to be delivered beyond our original delivery estimates.</p>
        
        <p class="p-PS"><strong>Payment Methods</strong><br />Available payment methods will be by credit cards and/or through PayPal as displayed on your checkout page.
