<p><strong>EXPRESS ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br />
  <br />
  When you visit Express through its websites, pages on social media websites or through one of our mobile applications, we collect certain information to enhance your online experience.&nbsp; To make it easier for you to understand what Express collects and uses through its various online channels, we have combined several privacy policies to provide this summary.&nbsp; As a result of this combination, you will notice two sections that were not in our prior www.express.com privacy policy that address location information collected through our mobile applications and what happens on pages that Express has on social media sites.&nbsp; While offered before, for ease of reference, we have gathered your choices on how your information is disclosed into one section.<br />
  <br />
  The online channels covered by this privacy policy include (1) www.express.com, m.express.com or any other Express website which links to this policy (our &ldquo;Websites&rdquo;), (2) Express pages on social media sites, such as Facebook (including the Express Shop on Facebook), Twitter and YouTube (&ldquo;Social Media Pages&rdquo;), and (3) mobile applications available for various smartphones provided by Express (&ldquo;Mobile Applications&rdquo;).&nbsp; The term &ldquo;Online Channels&rdquo; is used in this policy to refer to all of these channels.&nbsp; If a statement is only applicable to a specific Website, channel or channels, we will so specify. This policy also explains how Express uses and discloses information it collects through its Online Channels.&nbsp; Your use of the Websites, purchase through one of the Websites or purchase through an Express Social Media Page signifies acceptance of the terms of this privacy policy.<br />

  <strong>What Location Information Do we Collect?&nbsp; </strong></a><br />
  <br />
  Some services provided through the Express Mobile Applications will require the use of the GPS on your mobile device.&nbsp; If you are using the services that make use of the GPS on your mobile device, Express will collect, store and use your location data to provide services through the mobile application.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  <a name="info-collection">
  <strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ONLINE?</strong></a><br />
  <br />
  <strong>Collection of General Information:</strong><br />
  <br />
  Express gathers aggregate general browsing and usage information on all of its Online Channels.&nbsp; This may include navigational information about where visitors go on our Online Channels and information about the technical efficiencies of our online services (i.e. time to connect to our Websites or Mobile Applications, time to download pages, etc.). This information allows us to see which areas of each Online Channel are most visited and helps us better understand our customers&rsquo; experiences with the Express Online Channels. This helps us improve the quality of your online experiences by recognizing and delivering more of the preferred features, areas and services. In the process of gathering navigational information, we may also collect information such as domain type, browser version, service provider, type of smartphone, and IP address, which will provide information regarding a visitor&rsquo;s use of our Websites or Mobile Applications (such as the time of a visitor&rsquo;s last visit to a page on our site). <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Collection of Personal Information: </strong><br />
  <br />
  Express may ask you to provide personal information through its Online Channels.&nbsp; For example, when you establish or update an account on an Express Website (including establishing an account for our loyalty program), sign up for (thus, consent to receive) our emails, register through an Express Mobile Application, provide information directly to Express through a Social Media Page, enter a sweepstakes or contest, voluntarily participate in a survey, quiz or poll, shop online, make a purchase (including purchasing and sending a gift card), check the status of an order or review order history. <br />
  <br />
  Categories of information collected include name, address (shipping and billing), email address, recipient&rsquo;s name and e-mail address, order information, order number, telephone number, credit card information, gender, birthday, social media names, preferences, wish lists, profile information you may create on the social media sites where you interact with Express Social Media Pages, information about your friends on these social media sites,&nbsp; and demographic information if you voluntarily participate in a survey, quiz or poll.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  On www.express.com, you may also provide information to set up a profile and job agent if you are interested in a career with Express, LLC.&nbsp; The information you submit at www.express.com to create a career profile will include name, e-mail address, postal address, phone and, if you have one, your resume, plus the type of position you are seeking.<br />
  <br />
  Express may allow you to use your Facebook account information to provide us information requested when you participate in features on our Online Channels.

Please keep in mind that Facebook may change the types of information that may be accessed when you use this process to provide us information, so you should carefully review the Request for Permission from Facebook prior to using this method of providing information to any of our Online Channels. It is also possible that Express will be able to continue to collect this information from your Facebook account should the information be revised by you later. <br />
  <br />

  <br />
  The social media sites where Express has it Social Media Pages may provide aggregate information and analysis to Express about visitors&rsquo; use of our Social Media Pages, but this does not occur on the Express Shop portion of our Social Media Page on Facebook.&nbsp; This allows us to better understand and analyze our user growth, general demographic information about the users of our social media pages and interaction with content on our Social Media Pages.&nbsp; Overall, this information may be used to help us understand the types of visitors and users of our social media pages and use of the content. <br />

In those instances where you will register for the sweepstakes or contest by going to the linked website, you will be providing personal information, such as name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number and gender directly to the company that is hosting the sweepstakes or contest website.

  <br />
  You should be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if necessary to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with the law or to enforce or apply our Site Use Terms and Conditions or it is necessary to protect the users of our Online Channels, Express or the public.<br />
  <br />
  In the event Express sells or transfers a particular portion of its business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets transferred as part of the transaction. If substantially all of the assets of Express are acquired, consumer information may be transferred as part of the acquisition.&nbsp; In both cases, this could include information obtained through an Express Online Channel.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  In addition, we may participate with certain unrelated companies who will link you to one of our Online Channels from their website that you have visited, which may include recognition of purchases through such Online Channel.

  <a name="cookies">
  <strong>HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</strong></a><br />
  <br />
  1. What are cookies?<br />
  <br />
  Express Online Channels may use a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are typically stored on your computer&rsquo;s hard drive and are used by Express to help track clicks and pass information as you go through the pages within the specific Online Channel visited.&nbsp; Cookies also help us keep track of how many items you put into your shopping bag and to remember you when you return to Express. We may also use a cookie and/or a technology known as clear gifs or web bugs which are typically stored in e-mails to help us confirm your receipt of, and response to, our e-mails and provide you a more personalized experience. Cookies can allow us to associate navigational information from browsing visits with personal information you provide at our site. <br />
  <br />
  2. Do we share information from cookies with third parties?<br />
  We may share non-transactional behavioral data collected through the use of cookies after July 7, 2008 with other businesses.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  3. How do third parties use cookies on our Websites?<br />
  <br />
  <u>Advertising:</u> We select third-party advertising companies and allow them to collect non-personally identifiable information by placing cookies when you choose to visit them and when you visit an Express Website. These selected companies may use information (not including your name, address, credit card information, email address, or telephone number) about your choice to visit and your visits to our Websites and other websites to provide advertisements about our products and services on this and other websites. These selected companies also provide this information to us which we use to gauge the effectiveness of the advertisements they place about our products and services and for marketing purposes. <br />
  <br />
  Express does not use third-party behavioral advertising cookies on its Social Media Pages or Mobile Applications.&nbsp; However, the social media sites hosting the Social Media Pages may use third-party behavioral advertising cookies.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  <u>Analysis: </u>We have also selected companies that will assist us in better understanding your use of our Websites, Mobile Applications and the Express Shop on Facebook.&nbsp; These companies will place cookies on your computer upon a visit to one of our Websites or the Express Shop on Facebook or your use of a Mobile Application to collect information on our behalf and may also make use of web bugs. These companies may use both third-party and first-party cookies. Blocking cookies served from third-party domains will not block the first-party cookies. The information these companies collect educates us on such things as search engine referral, how you navigate around the Website, Mobile Application or the Express Shop on Facebook you have elected to visit or download, traffic driven by banner ads, responses to email, unique visitor identification, and product browsing and purchasing information, and allows us to better serve your interests and provide you with more personalized product offerings. Express does not allow these companies to collect credit card, username or password information.&nbsp; The information collected on our behalf is analyzed and returned to Express. We may allow these companies to use collected data on an aggregate basis.&nbsp; The analysis of this information is required to be maintained by these service providers in confidence. <br />
