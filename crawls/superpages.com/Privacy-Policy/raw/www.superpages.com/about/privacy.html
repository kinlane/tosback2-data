<h1>Privacy Policy - Straight talk about Internet privacy </h1>
 
<p>SuperMedia LLC (&quot;SuperMedia&quot;) respects your right to privacy, and
we want you to be aware of how we collect and handle information on each
website and mobile application covered by this policy.</p>
 
<p><strong>This Privacy Policy applies only to the user privacy of the
www.superpages.com, www.localsearch.com,
www.superguarantee.com, www.directorystore.com, www.everycarlisted.com, Freegrader.com, www.m.superpages.com, <a href="http://www.wap.superpages.com/">www.wap.superpages.com</a>
and www.m.everycarlisted.com websites and Superpages<sup>SM</sup> mobile applications
(each, &quot;This Website&quot;, as applicable). It does not apply to
the offline activities of SuperMedia LLC or any of its affiliates.</strong></p>
 
<h3>Privacy Policy Effective Date / Updates</h3>
 
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 23, 2011.Our business changes
constantly. Our Privacy Policy will change also, and information collected
through This Website is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the
information is collected (unless you consent otherwise as to information
related to you). You are advised to check this web page (or such other page
accessible by clicking on the Privacy Policy link in the footer of This
Website) frequently to see recent changes. SuperMedia will notify users of any
changes to this Privacy Policy by posting the version of the Privacy Policy
containing such changes on this web page (or such other page accessible by
clicking on the Privacy Policy link in the footer of This Website).</p>
 
<h2>Information SuperMedia Collects<a name=informationcollected></a></h2>
 
<h3>What information does This Website gather?</h3>
 
<p>When you visit This Website, SuperMedia may collect the following types of
information: </p>
 
<ul type=disc>
 <li>Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide </li>
 <li>Information SuperMedia Collects Automatically </li>
 <li>Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide </li>
</ul>
 
<p><u>Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</u>. SuperMedia collects
personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For
example, SuperMedia may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact
information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number). If
you purchase a product or service, SuperMedia may ask you to provide additional
information such as your credit card information. If you register for the SuperGuarantee&reg; Program, SuperMedia will ask you to
provide additional information about any service appointment you register and
may track your searches and any registrations, claims and ratings/reviews you
file on This Website. If you file a claim under the SuperGuarantee&reg;
Program or apply for the Superpages LocalServe&reg; Program, SuperMedia may ask you to provide
additional information such as your Social Security number. If you request
information relating to the sale or purchase of a vehicle on This Website, we
may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information and
information relating to the vehicle. Finally, in some cases (for example, if you register with us or sign-in
on This Website or purchase a product or service) SuperMedia may also ask you
to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, security question
and answer, and birthday.</p>
 
<p>If you choose to use an available referral service on This Website (e.g., to
send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc.), we will ask for
certain personal information from the recipient (e.g., the recipient's name,
e-mail address, mobile telephone number) and your name and e-mail address.
SuperMedia uses the personally identifiable referral information you provide to
facilitate this communication on a one-time basis, and may also store and use
such personally identifiable information for analysis purposes (e.g., tracking
the success of the referral feature). </p>
 
<p>You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all personally
identifiable information that you knowingly provide.</p>
 
<p><u>Information Automatically Collected</u>. In addition, as you (and other users)
browse This Website, our web servers, and non &#8220;SuperMedia Family&#8221; companies
with which SuperMedia has an agreement may, automatically collect and track certain
information about such visits, usually through the use of browser <a
href="privacy.html#Cookies">cookies</a>,
JavaScript files and tagging, web address tracking codes, file impression
counts, &quot;web beacons&quot;, and the analysis of http headers
(&#8220;Tracking Methods&#8221;). These Tracking Methods provide information such as the user's IP
address, the user's domain name, the user's browser type, the user's user
agent, how many users visit This Website, which pages the user visits and for
how long, the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet
address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website and the
links on This Website on which the user clicks. In addition, SuperMedia may
collect certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user
which are not entered by the user.</p>
 
<p><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide</u>. In
some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that
you provide, such as search parameters in connection with a search you conduct
through This Website, ratings and reviews, and zip code. </p>
 
<p>To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This
Website's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We
will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are
aware of developments in this area. </p>
 
<h3>How does SuperMedia use information collected on This Website?</h3>
 
<p><u>Specific Purpose</u>. When users supply personally
identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example,
to register to use a feature on This Website, to purchase a product or service,
to obtain a free listing, to register for a program or to use a feature of a
program, to receive information, or to apply for a job), we may use such
information for such purpose.</p>
 
<p><u>Similar to Information Collected in Traditional Non-Electronic Manner</u>. 
We also may use personally identifiable
information users provide as we would use the same information obtained in a
traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use such personally
identifiable information to assess your credit rating, to publish your name,
address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a
non-published number), to contact you in connection with a program you are
participating in, user reviews and/or to evaluate your service needs, and to
contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. When users provide
personally identifiable information in connection with a feature on This
Website, we may also use such personally identifiable information in connection
with the operation of such feature. (For example, if you register to use the
personalized directory service, we may use the personally identifiable
information you provide to provide you with a more personalized and useful
service, and if you create a review of a business on This Website, we may
publish your initials, city and state in connection with such review.) When
users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a contest,
sweepstakes or other promotion that we may run on This Website, we may use such
information to administer such contest, sweepstakes or promotion and to notify
winners. </p>
 
<p><u>Communicate with You</u>. We
may also use personally identifiable information you provide or that is
automatically collected to communicate with you (e.g., to send you e-mails) and
to otherwise serve you. For example, we may use your name and e-mail address to
send you e-mails to (a) provide information regarding our company, marketing
information about our products and services or the products and services of
other companies, and newsletters, (b) conduct online surveys, (c) confirm your
registration on This Website, a service registration, or orders placed online
and (d) otherwise communicate with you. However, you may request not to receive
(i.e., &quot;opt-out&quot; of receiving) commercial e-mail messages (the
primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a
commercial product or service) from us (on a category-by-category basis), by
clicking on <a
href="http://my.supermedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp"
target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the
e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the
e-mail campaign opt-out page. If you have previously opted out of receiving
commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may cancel
your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail messages
from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis) by
clicking on <a
href="http://my.supermedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp"
target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the
e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the
e-mail campaign opt-out page. Please note that we reserve the right to send
certain types of e-mail messages that are not subject to opt-out (see
information about <a
href="privacy.html#email">e-mails</a>,
below) to online users, including those who have opted out of receiving
commercial e-mail messages. Your personally identifiable information may also
be used by non-&#8220;SuperMedia Family&#8221; companies, with which we have
agreements, to provide you information about their products and services.</p>
 
<p><u>Protect SuperMedia&#8217;s Property or Other
Rights</u>.In addition, SuperMedia
may use personally identifiable information you provide and information
SuperMedia automatically collects through this website (and may combine
personally identifiable information you provide with information SuperMedia
automatically collects through This Website and non-personally identifiable
information you knowingly provide) as it deems appropriate to protect its
property or other rights (for example, to enforce any policies or contractual
provisions regarding use of the &quot;ratings and reviews&quot; feature or the
&quot;send a listing&quot; feature). </p>
 
<p><u>Improve Website and Targeted Advertising</u>. We use information SuperMedia
automatically collects through This Website to improve This Website, to monitor
its performance, to make This Website easier for you and other users to use, to
manage features and programs made available through This Website and to provide
behavioral tracking data to non-&#8220;SuperMedia Family&#8221; companies, with
which we have agreements, for the purpose of presenting you with, among other
things, targeted advertising on third party websites. For example, SuperMedia
may use information SuperMedia automatically collects in the ways described in
the section entitled <a
href="privacy.html#Cookies">&quot;What
is a cookie and why does SuperMedia use them?&quot;</a>, below.</p>
 
<h3>Can I review and request changes to personally identifiable information
that I provide through registration forms on This Website?</h3>
 
<p><u>Create and Update Profile</u>. If you use an available capability on This Website to register with us
and create a profile, at any time after you register and create a profile, you
may review and request changes to any personally identifiable information you
provided through the registration form, by viewing and updating your profile
within the application.</p>
 
<p><u>Opt-Out of Receiving Commercial E-Mail Messages</u>. In addition, (i)
you may request not to receive (i.e., &quot;opt-out&quot; of receiving)
commercial e-mail messages from us (on a category-by category basis), by
clicking on <a href="http://my.supermedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp" target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the
e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the
e-mail campaign opt-out page, and (ii) if you have previously opted out of
receiving commercial e-mail messages related to one or more categories, you may
cancel your request to opt-out of (i.e., consent to receive commercial e-mail
messages from us related to) such categories (on a category-by-category basis)
by clicking on <a
href="http://my.supermedia.com/customersupport/contactus/opt/opt.jsp"
target="_blank">Update Your Email Preferences</a> (or otherwise visiting the
e-mail campaign opt-out page), and following the directions provided on the
e-mail campaign opt-out page. Please note that we reserve the right to send
certain types of e-mail messages that are not subject to opt-out (see
information about <a
href="privacy.html#email">e-mails</a>,
below) to online users, including those who have opted out of receiving
commercial e-mail messages. </p>
 
<h3>Do you sell or provide my information collected through This Website to
companies outside of the &quot;SuperMedia Family?&quot;</h3>
 
<p><u>Information Provided by You</u>. Except as otherwise disclosed in this
policy, we do not sell or disclose personally identifiable information you
provide to us through This Website to anyone outside of the &quot;SuperMedia
Family&quot; unless (i) you specifically authorize
it, (ii) it is to complete a transaction, service or activity that you
initiated or requested, (iii) it is to provide a service on behalf of
SuperMedia (for example, SuperMedia may contract with an entity outside of the
&quot;SuperMedia Family&quot; to send e-mail messages on behalf of SuperMedia),
in which case such non- &quot;SuperMedia Family&quot; entities are not
permitted to use such information for any purpose other than to provide such
service, (iv) it is to assess your credit ranking or report your failure to
fulfill your payment obligations in connection with the purchase of (or
application to purchase) products or services through This Website, (v) it is
required by law or we believe that such action is necessary in order to conform
to the edicts of the law, (vi) we believe that disclosure is necessary to
protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or
legal process served, (vii) we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect
the safety of customers, employees or property, or (viii) SuperMedia transfers
all or substantially all of its assets to another entity (in which case
SuperMedia may disclose, sell and/or otherwise provide personally identifiable
information to such entity). If you provide personally identifiable information
to us in the context of an event SuperMedia sponsors on This Website with
another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored
section or feature of This Website, you may also be providing such personally
identifiable information to the co-sponsor. When you provide your personally
identifiable information to any third party, SuperMedia is not responsible for
any third party's use of such personally identifiable information.</p>
 
<p><u>Information Automatically Collected</u>. SuperMedia may share information it
automatically collects through This Website with non-&quot;SuperMedia
Family&quot; companies in order to assess the results of a promotion, event or
third party relationship, to provide information to current or prospective
customers, to complete a transaction, service, search or other activity that
the user initiated or requested, to non-&#8220;SuperMedia Family&#8221;
companies, with which we have agreements, to, among other things, facilitate
targeted advertising on third party websites, or to otherwise enhance your
online experience. For example, we may provide information SuperMedia
automatically collects: </p>
 
<ul type=disc>
 <li>When you link to another site
     from This Website. </li>
 <li>When you request certain
     information that SuperMedia obtains from a third party. </li>
 <li>When we host co-branded
     versions of This Website (or portions of This Website). Our co-branded
     websites may also contain clear .gif files (electronic images that allow
     This Website to automatically collect information about your visit to the
     website). </li>
</ul>
 
<p>When we use third party tracking services to help us analyze automatically
collected information in the aggregate to evaluate the effectiveness of This
Website, the third parties performing such tracking services are not permitted
to use the information for any other purpose.</p>
 
<p>We may also disclose information SuperMedia automatically collects to
non-&quot;SuperMedia Family&quot; companies or entities if (a) it is required
by law or we believe that such action is necessary in order to conform to the
edicts of the law, (b) we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our
rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal
process served, (c) we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect the
safety of customers, employees or property, or (d) SuperMedia transfers all or
substantially all of its assets to another entity (in which case SuperMedia may

from third parties that serve advertising, on This Website. SuperMedia may use its

     advertising </li>
 <li>Deliver product and pricing
     advertising/information applicable to the customers' state </li>
 <li>Gauge the effectiveness of
     our online advertising </li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Security</h2>
 
<h3>What security measures are in place to restrict access to personally
identifiable information?</h3>
 
<p>SuperMedia is committed to protecting your
personally identifiable information that you provide through This Website. This
Website is protected with a variety of security measures such as change control
procedures and physical access controls (and passwords, as applicable). We also
implement other control mechanisms in an effort to help protect personally
identifiable information that you provide through This Website from being lost,
misused or altered inappropriately.</p>
 
<p>This Website supports 128 bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to
transmit certain information (e.g., credit card information provided by the
user and social security numbers provided by the user). SSL is a transport
level technology for authentication and data encryption between a web server
and a web browser. SSL sends data over the &quot;socket&quot;, which is a
secure channel at the connection layer. </p>
 
<h2>Cookies<a name=Cookies></a></h2>
 
<h3>What is a cookie and why does SuperMedia use them?</h3>
 
<p>A cookie is a small data string our server writes to your hard drive that
contains your unique User ID for This Website. Cookies help us to identify new
and returning users to This Website, analyze click-stream data, and track
historical activity on This Website, which allows us to give you a more
personalized, useful experience on This Website. Cookies may be placed by us,
by a third-party that provides services to us, or a non-&#8220;SuperMedia
Family&#8221; company, with which we have an agreement.</p>
 
<p>Cookies help SuperMedia to enhance the user's online experience and can be used to: </p>
 
<ul type=disc>
 <li>deliver the appropriate geographic message </li>
 <li>manage frequency of ad  exposure; avoid over delivery of the same message </li>
 <li>tailor an advertisement or  other content to better match your interests and preferences </li>
 <li>ensure that you see the  correct products and pricing applicable to the state in which you live </li>
 <li>keep track of your order as you order services </li>
 <li>understand advertising effectiveness </li>
 <li>manage features and programs  made available through This Website </li>
 <li>collect anonymous traffic data </li>
</ul>
 
<p>A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your
hard drive. However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most
internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive,
block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.</p>
 
<p>You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do
not want us to establish and maintain a unique User ID. Please be aware that
cookies may be required to complete certain functions on This Website, such as
ordering products or services, and, also in connection with personalized sections
of This website, for example My <span class=SpellE>Superpages</span>. To
disable cookies, see <a href="privacy.html#setcookies">&quot;Setting
Cookie Preferences&quot;</a>, below. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>To opt-out of the placement of behavioral
tracking cookies, see &#8220;How to Opt-out of Behavior Tracking Cookies&#8221;
below.</p>
 
<p>However, you need to understand that some websites/ad serving companies have
the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you
reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the ad
serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data. </p>
 
<p>Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from
reestablishing history on a user. The user must either continue to decline cookies
each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or
opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is
erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new
cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to
attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not
contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify
your computer uniquely. </p>
 
<p>Users who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have
their browser advise them each time a website attempts to send a cookie to your
system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept
or Cancel a cookie. Users who choose to &quot;opt out&quot; after deleting
cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie. </p>
