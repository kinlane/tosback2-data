            <br /><p>SpeedDate offers location-enabled services and may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). Your location may also be transmitted off of your mobile device even when an application is closed. You agree to share your location with SpeedDate on a continuous and periodic basis. While, we never share your exact location with another member, the location may be used to measure your proximity to other users and cause notifications to be sent to other users notifying them that you are nearby. The messaging to other users with whom you are matched may include your approximate distance from them as well as your profile and photograph. Other SpeedDate members may use or disclose your information to others without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about members with whom you choose to interact.</p>

            <br /><p>We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Service. "Cookies" are small files placed on Your hard drive that assist Us in providing customized services. Certain features of the Service are only available with the use of a "cookie." We use this information to determine Our members' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve You and other members. This information may include the URL of the website that You visited prior to the Service (whether this URL is on the Service or not), the URL of the website You next go to (whether this URL is on the Service or not), what browser You are using and Your Internet Protocol address. Most cookies are "session cookies" meaning that they are automatically deleted from Your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free not to accept cookies if Your browser permits. We may also collect Information such as your name, contact information, date of birth, and credit card information at places within the Service where we request such information (e.g., during registration, when you pay for premium features, when you populate your profile).</p>

            <br /><p>We may use a third party advertising company to serve ads on Our behalf across the Internet. That advertising company may also collect anonymous information about Your visits to the Service. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a technology device, commonly referred to as a Web beacon, cookie or an action tag, which is placed on various Web pages within the Service or in an HTML email that allows the third party advertising company to collect anonymous information. There may also be a number of services offered by external service providers that help You use the Service. If You choose to use these optional services and in doing so disclose information to the external service providers or grant them permission to collect information about You, then their use of Your information will be governed by their privacy policies, if any.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Our Use and Sharing of Information</p>
            <b>We may use Information collected in connection with the Service in the following ways:</b>
            <br /><ul>

                <li>To enable users to enter prize promotions and receive prizes from Us and/or third parties</li>
                <li>To improve the user experience with the Service</li>

            </ul>


            <br /><p>In order to do the foregoing, We may provide the Information to trusted third parties, including but not limited to selected marketers and social networks as well as third party contractors providing services to Us such as the operation of the Service, financial verification and payment services, communication services and fulfillment of orders, and information verification.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to limit use of the Information by such third parties to the specific uses set forth above.  We may also provide Information to other Web sites We operate, and/or other business units within or to Our affiliated entities.</p>

            <br /><p>Although we use industry-standard efforts to protect the Information We collect via the Service, we cannot guarantee that this information will not be accessed by the government or third parties in certain circumstances. We may be required by law to disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or third parties. You authorize us to report consumer transaction data to third parties for fraud prevention services. In addition, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications and members may abuse or misuse Your information that they collect from the Service. Accordingly, You should not expect that Your Information or private communications will remain private in all circumstances.</p>

            <br /><p>We use information in the data files We maintain about You, and the other information We obtain from Your current and past activities on the Service to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce Our Terms of Use. We may review the data of multiple members to identify problems or resolve disputes.</p>

            <br /><p>We may use Information, data files and other information about You including but not limited to images, video recordings, and audio recordings to improve Our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze usage of the Service, improve Our content and product offerings, and customize the Service content, layout, and features.</p>

            <br /><p>We aggregate Information of Our members and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify You personally. We do not disclose certain Information, such as Your name, email address, password, credit card number and bank account number, to marketing advertisers. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on Our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness.</p>

            <br /><p>We may require that you submit certain financial information, including Your credit card billing information. We will use this information to bill You for use of Our Services and products. By making a purchase, or engaging in any other kind of activity or transaction that uses financial information on the Service, You consent to Our providing Your financial information to Our service providers and to such third parties as We determine necessary to support and process Your transactions. These third parties may include the credit card companies and banking institutions used to process and support Your transactions.

These third parties will be authorized to use Your financial information in accordance with Our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which We have no control, and You agree that We are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions.</p>

            <br /><p>We may share data collected via the Service, including Information about You, with Our parent, affiliates, or subsidiaries. Our parent, affiliates and subsidiaries will follow privacy practices no less protective of such Information than Our practices described in this Privacy Policy. It is possible that We could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such merger or acquisition occur, We would share some or all of Your Information with the merger partner or acquiring party. The acquiring entity or newly combined entity will follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy with respect to such information.</p>

            <br /><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, if you post information, including Information, on portions of the Service that are made available to other users or to the public (including to your public profile), the restrictions on the use and disclosure of such information contained in this privacy policy will not apply to that information and We may use and disclose such information as permitted in the section of the Terms of Use titled "Member-Submitted Content."</p>

            <br /><p>We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries and with third parties to enforce laws. You authorize Us to disclose any information about You to law enforcement and other government officials as We in Our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with any investigation of fraud or other activity that is illegal or may expose Us or You to liability.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Email Policies</p>
            <p>By default, we will send you periodic updates of various site information, a variety of transactional emails such as when users send you a message and the occasional site announcement.</p>

            <br /><p>You have full control regarding which of these emails you want to receive. To change your options, simply click "Email Alerts" in the Profile tab from any page.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Inviting Friends</p>
            <p>Inviting friends to SpeedDate.comâ¢ is always completely optional. When you choose to invite friends, we will send an email to the addresses you enter indicating that it is a message from you. We will share your name and email address with anyone you invite so that they know who the invitation is coming from. If a friend does not respond to the initial invitation after a little while, we will send up to one reminder messages on your behalf. Your friends may contact us to request that we remove their information from our database.</p>

            <br /><p>For your convenience, SpeedDate.comâ¢ offers the ability to import email addresses from common address books such as Hotmail/Yahoo/Gmail/AOL. If you choose to use this feature, we will access your address book using the login details that you provide. We access your address book only once to retrieve your friends' information so that you may select whom to invite. We do not store your login details nor do we use them for any other purpose than to retrieve your contacts. We never send invitations to contacts you do not leave preselected or explicitly select, and your invitations are the only email we will ever send to your friends unless they register to join the site.</p>

            <br /><p>If you have accidentally sent invitations you did not intend - please contact us and we can cancel the reminder message.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Wireless Policy</p>
            <p>Pursuant to the above, We may use Information to provide the services requested by You, including utilizing a provided cell phone number for voice communication with You and services that display customized content and advertising via SMS messages sent to such provided cell phone number. In addition to any fee of which You are notified, Your provider's standard messaging rates apply to Our confirmation and all subsequent SMS correspondence. You may opt-out and remove Your SMS information by sending "LEAVE SPEEDDATE" to the SMS text message You have received. </p>

            <br /><p>All standard messaging charges are billed by and payable to Your mobile service provider. We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from Your network operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS basis.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Your Use of Other Members' Information</p>
            <p>Our services may include access to instant messaging and chat rooms. As a member You have access to members' identification numbers or user names and You might gain access to other contact information of other members through the use of the Service.Â You may not use such information in any manner that is not authorized by Us and the applicable member. In all cases, You must give members an opportunity to remove their information from Your information databases, including email lists. Under no circumstances may You disclose Information about another member to any third party without Our consent and the consent of such other member. You may not add a member to an mail list (email or physical mail) without that member's express consent.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Profile</p>
            <p>After registration You can review and change the information You submitted during registration. For instructions on how to do so visit the "Help" section of the Service.</p>

            <br /><p>Upon Your request We will remove Your membership data from Our active databases as soon as reasonably possible in accordance with Our policy and applicable law.

We may retain in Our files information You have requested be removed from Our active databases for certain purposes, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce the Terms of Use. Moreover, such prior information may never be completely removed from Our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored 'back up' systems. You should not expect that all of Your Information will be completely removed from Our databases in response to Your request.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Control of Your Password</p>
            <p>You are responsible for all actions taken with Your login information and password, including any fees or charges incurred based on such use.

            <p class="subtitle">Third Party Use of Information</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information We collect from You. If You disclose Your Information to other parties, whether via the Service or on other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information You disclose to them.
