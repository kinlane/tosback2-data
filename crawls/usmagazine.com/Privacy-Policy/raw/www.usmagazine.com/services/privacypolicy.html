<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The website usmagazine.com is owned and operated by Us Weekly LLC and its affiliates (collectively, "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>our</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>").  This privacy policy ("<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>") explains our information collection practices at usmagazine.com, other websites owned by us and our other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile websites and applications (each, an "<strong>Us Application</strong>") and through offline means.  It explains the types of information we collect regarding users of the Us Application and subscribers to our magazine and how we may use that information so you can make an informed decision about whether to view the content and/or use our services ("<strong>Services</strong>").  Thus this Privacy Policy applies to information we collect via (1) the Us Application (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise); (2) email or electronic newsletters; (3) offline means such as telephone and traditional mail; and (4) any other means or applications in which you connect with us. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Us Application's <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/services/terms">Terms of Use</a>. Each time that you access or use the Us Application you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/services/terms">Terms of Use</a>, and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/services/terms">Terms of Use</a> and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using our Services.</p>

<h3>1.	Information That Is Collected</h3>

<p>When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity, product or service or provide your contact information, including your email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you expressly consent to our communicating with you about our products or services using the information you provided to us.  You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you.  This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p>

<h4>(a)	Information You Provide To Us</h4>

<p><em><strong>Personal Information</strong></em>.  We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, gender, e-mail address, date of birth, physical address (or elements thereof such as zip code and state) ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>").  We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Us Application, including magazine subscription forms, account registration forms, contact us forms or when you otherwise interact with us.</p> 

<p><em><strong>Billing and Credit Card Information</strong></em>.  To enable payment for subscriptions, we collect and store billing and credit card information.  This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction.  Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit cards.</p>

<p><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em>.  You may be given the option to link your Facebook account so that you can comment on the Us Application or take advantage of other features of the Us Application. When you comment on the Us Application using your Facebook username and password and clicking "allow" on the Facebook permission authorization screen, you give us permission to capture, store, use and display your Facebook user ID, your basic Facebook profile information and any other information from your Facebook profile that you specifically allow us to access. The authentication of your Facebook login credentials are conducted through Facebook.</p>

<h4>(b)	Information Collected As You Access and Use the Us Application</h4>

<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Us Application ("<strong>Usage Information</strong>").  This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our Us Application, all of the areas within our Us Application that you visit, and the time of day, among other information.  We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Us Application.  In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("<strong>Device Identifier</strong>") for your computer or other device used to access the Us Application (any, a "<strong>Device</strong>") and may combine your Device Identifier with information from third party sources to identify your Device's location by state and region ("<strong>Region Location</strong>") or more specific information about your geographic location for certain Us Applications ("<strong>Geolocation</strong>"), as more clearly spelled out in this policy.  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Us Application, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you.  Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>

<p>A few of the tracking technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:</p>

<p><em><strong>Cookies</strong></em>.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Us Application.  We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Us Application.  Cookies are stored on users' hard drives.  We use both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies."  Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Us Application and expire when the user closes his/her browser.  Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Us Application easier for returning users by remembering a user's login information.  Persistent cookies stay on a user's hard drive from one session to the next.  "Flash cookies," known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>.  If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Us Application may not function properly.</p>

<p><em><strong>Web Beacons</strong></em>.  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our web pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Us Application, to monitor how users navigate the Us Application, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>

<p><em><strong>Embedded Scripts</strong></em>.  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Us Application, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Us Application, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>

<p id="html5"><em><strong>HTML5</strong></em>. We use HTML5 in the Us Weekly mobile website and certain mobile applications for the iphone or ipad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser "cookies" file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>

<p><em><strong>Geolocation Us Applications</strong></em>. For certain of the mobile Us Applications that have search functionality, we may, and may enable a third party such as an advertiser to, ask you if you wish us to collect your geolocation in order provide you with information about goods and services within your geographic location. If you agree to have your geolocation collected, we and the third party, if applicable, will maintain information about your geolocation to facilitate your searching.  In addition, when you have geolocation software running on your mobile phone, computer or other Device, we may collect that information as controlled by your privacy settings on those Devices. </p>
    
<h4>(c)	Information You Provide About a Third Party</h4>

<p>If you send someone else a communication from the Us Application, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  If that person becomes a subscriber to our magazine or newsletter, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other subscribers.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Us Application, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>

	<h4>(d)	Information We Collect from Third Parties</h4>
    
<p>We may acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information that you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic information and lifestyle information.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.</p>

<h3>2.	How We Use and Share the Information Collected</h3>

<p><strong>(a)	Use of Information by Us</strong>.  We may use the information that we collect about you: (1) to provide you with information or services or to process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive; (2) to provide you with information regarding new features, products or services; (3) to improve our Services and to customize your experience on the Us Application; (4) to contact you with regard to your use of the Us Application and, in our discretion, changes to the Us Application and/or the Us Application's policies; and (5) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p><strong>(b)	Transactional Communications</strong>.  We may send you notices from time to time relating to your account, your subscriptions and other products and services you have requested or in which you are currently enrolled.  These may include order confirmations, renewal notices, invoices or customer service notifications. We may also send you service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so; for instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a product is delayed or there is some service issue with something you may have ordered.  If you are a print subscriber to our magazine and do not wish to receive email bills, renewal notices and other communications regarding your magazine subscription by email, you can click <a href="https://secure.customersvc.com/servlet/Show?WESPAGE=am/home.jsp&MSRSMAG=US" target="_blank">here</a> and select this option on the Us Application's customer service page. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving subscriber communications by email, we may continue to send you subscriber communications by direct mail.</p>  

<p><strong>(c)	Email Newsletters</strong>.   We may send you our email newsletter(s).  If you wish to unsubscribe from our email newsletter(s), simply follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email newsletter or click <a href="http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2?a=0&aid=2068052157&n=4" target="_blank">here</a> to manage your newsletter preferences.</p> 

<p id="email-promotions"><strong>(d)	Email Marketing Offers</strong>.  We may send you promotional emails regarding special offers about our products and services or on behalf of third party marketing partners who we think can offer services and products of interest to you. We may also share your name and email address and certain other information, such as when you first subscribed, with reputable companies that provide marketing offers through email.  If you do not want us to send you emails regarding special promotions or offers or share your Personal Information with other companies so that they can send you email offers, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions that are located at the bottom of those emails or you can click <a href="http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2?a=0&aid=2068052157&n=4" target="_blank">here</a> to manage your email marketing preferences.
