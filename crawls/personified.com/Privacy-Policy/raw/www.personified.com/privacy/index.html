<li>Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us by third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect information stored in your social media profile that you authorize us to access when you use your social media profile to enact features on the Sites, such as the ability to pre-populate our registration form or a job application, or the ability to see which of your friends have contacts with employers that interest you. CareerBuilder provides software applications (“Apps&#8221;) available to the public, as well as Apps that may be purchased by companies for their employee’s internal use in talent management or as a company-specific social networking intranet. Through the use of these Apps, we may collect your social network data, but will never use nor share non-public social network data that you have restricted through your social network’s privacy settings.</p>
<ul>

<li>If you decide to download one of our Social Media applications, such as Work@ or NetworkEffect, we will also collect information about your friends and their connections. This includes, depending on your friend’s privacy settings, names, locations, and employment histories.</li>
<li>Through use of the Work@ App, the individuals with whom you have a relationship on the social networking site may provide their contact information to you or directly to CareerBuilder’s customers when they request a referral or they apply for a job. CareerBuilder will collect the contact information of the individuals with whom you have a relationship on the social networking site in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the relevant terms of use associated with that social networking site. Depending on those individuals’ privacy settings, such information can include their social network site user ID, name, city, state, social network site profile image URL, and employment history, including job titles and company names.</li>
<li>When you use the Work@ or NetworkEffect App on your social network page or use the Work@ App on someone else&#8217;s page, we may record information regarding the use of that Work@ App.</li>
<li>If social network connections use the Work@ App to apply for a job or request a referral, CareerBuilder will collect those individuals’ names and email addresses and notify you about this activity.</li>
<li>When you invite individuals from your social network to use our Apps, make an introduction between individuals in your social network and other Work@ or NetworkEffect members, or send messages through the Work@ App, we collect and maintain the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.</li>
<li>We do not collect information on social media private messages that are not hosted by our App, unless we are a party to the message, such as when a user sends an app invite request.</li>
<li>Users of company-specific CareerBuilder products, such as the intra-net social networking app WorkLife, provide information to update and expand their employee social profiles and company-activity groups, in combination with basic directory information provided by your employer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How We Use the Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We may use the information we obtain about you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register, manage and maintain your account on the Sites.</li>
<li>Provide products or services you request.</li>
<li>Process, validate and deliver your purchases (including by processing payment card transactions and contacting you about your orders, including by telephone).</li>

<li>Contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant services, educational or other career development opportunities); enable you to communicate with us through our blogs, social networks and other interactive media; and solicit your feedback and input. These communications will contain links for preference management and, where appropriate, unsubscribe links should you decide you do not want to receive further communications.</li>

</ul>
<p>We also use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer and your access of the Sites (including your internet protocol address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the Sites. We collect this information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, as described in more detail <a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/JobSeeker/Info/privacy.aspx#cookies">below</a>.</p>
<p>If we seek to use the information we obtain about you in other ways, we will provide specific notice and request your consent at the time of collection.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/JobSeeker/Info/privacy.aspx#top">(Return to Top)</a> <a id="infoweshare"></a></p>
<h3>INFORMATION WE SHARE</h3>
<p>When you apply for a job through the Sites or publicly post your resume to our resume database, employers will have access to information about you and your potential interest in employment opportunities. Those employers may use your information to contact you directly. Additionally, when you apply for a job through the Sites, the information supplied by you becomes part of the CareerBuilder database but also may become part of the employer’s database. Similarly, if your resume is downloaded by an employer, your resume may become a part of the employer’s database. In these instances, the use of such information by the employer will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for that company’s use of your information.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may combine certain non-personally identifiable aggregate data about our users and use such anonymous aggregate data to prepare reports for our users (typically employers or educators). “Aggregate Data&#8221; is the demographic information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together. Aggregate data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not identify any specific individuals. For example, an employer may purchase a report from CareerBuilder that states the number of accountants with at least five year’s experience that live within a certain geographic area. All such reports sold only contain aggregate data which cannot be used to identify any individuals.</p>
<p>We also provide reports about activity on our Work@ App that may contain identifiable information about users who choose to download and use that App. CareerBuilder’s customers that purchase the Work@ App will receive reports that contain the information collected through the Work@ App. The reports may include the following: the number of installations and removals of the Work@ App, the number of referrals, shares and wall posts made by you, the number of views and the names and email addresses of individuals with whom you have a relationship when they request a referral or when they apply for a job. CareerBuilder will not provide any other social network page content to its customers who purchase the Work@ App. Similarly, we will not share any non-public social network page content with employers, potential employers or others through your use of NetworkEffect.</p>
<p>Information and communications on company-specific CareerBuilder products, such as the intra-net social networking app WorkLife, is accessible by your employer even where sub-group membership may be limited to employees with similar interests or employment duties. Information, communications and activities on the intra-net social networking app will also be subject to your employer’s internal policies and code of conduct in addition to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Other than instances where users opt to publicly post their Personal Information to our resume database, provide it via a job application, include it in a job posting or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users&#8217; Personal Information to anyone for any reason. When posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display. All users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute Personal Information (such as their email address or other contact information on a public resume) via the Sites or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages, for which CareerBuilder is not responsible, from third parties.</p>
<p>Where you have provided Personal Information on a Site that is ‘hosted’ or ‘co-branded’ by another company then that information will be made available to both CareerBuilder and the hosting/co-branding company. CareerBuilder is not responsible for what the hosting/co-branding company, or any third party with whom you may share your Personal Information, subsequently does with your information. You should review the privacy policy of the hosting/co-branding company to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information.</p>

<h3>Resume Privacy Options</h3>
<p>Posting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of thousands of employers with open positions each day. When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for you using the email address and password that you supply. When you return to the Sites in the future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume.</p>
<p>We know that our job seekers have varying levels of comfort when it comes to posting their resume on the Internet. To accommodate the needs of all users, CareerBuilder has 2 levels of resume privacy from which you can choose. Please note that these privacy settings only apply to whether or not your resume can be viewed by third parties. CareerBuilder will still collect, use or disclose anonymous, aggregated information about you and your visits to our website in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Standard Posting</h3>
<p>This option gives you the most visibility to the broadest employer audience possible by making your resume searchable in our resume database. If you select this option, any registered employer user who purchases access to the database can view your resume and contact details (to the extent you include them in your resume).</li>
<li>
<h3>Private Posting For Apply Online Only</h3>
<p>This option allows you to post your resume on the Sites without having it searchable by or viewable to employers. The benefit is that you can quickly and easily apply for jobs without retyping your information, and you provide your resume only to those employers you are specifically interested in.</li>
</ol>
<p>We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database to legitimate users such as paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We cannot control the use of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly, you should not put information you would not want made public in your resume.</p>

<h3>Some Important Tips To Use When Dealing With Prospective Employers</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should use your own careful judgment about whether and what information to provide prospective employers.</li>
<li>DO NOT PUT SENSITIVE INFORMATION, SUCH AS YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, ON YOUR RESUME.</li>
<li>CareerBuilder’s Sites are open to the public, and we cannot guarantee that all users of our services have a legitimate need to the information they seek.</li>
<li>Do not provide your social security number, national identification number or any state, provincial or other local identification number to a prospective employer via online application. Identity thieves may attempt to trick you into providing sensitive information. Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e., your social security number or any other state or national identification number, eye color, marital status, etc.) over the phone or online.</li>
<li>Job seekers should never provide credit card or bank numbers or engage in a monetary transaction of any sort.</li>
<li>Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country.</li>
</ul>
