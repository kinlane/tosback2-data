                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Welcome to eBay. &nbsp;By using eBay (including eBay.com and its related sites, services and tools), you agree to the following terms with eBay Inc. and the general principles for the websites of our subsidiaries and international affiliates. &nbsp;If you reside outside of the United States, you are contracting with one of our international eBay companies: In countries within the European Union, your contract is with eBay Europe S.à r.l.; in India, your contract is with eBay India Private Limited; in all other countries, your contract is with eBay International AG.</p>
                <p style="">This Agreement is effective on October 10, 2012, for current users, and upon acceptance for new users. &nbsp;You accept this User Agreement by clicking the <b class="boldTxt">Submit</b> button when registering an eBay account; accessing or using eBay's sites, services, and tools; or as otherwise indicated on a specific site, service, or tool. &nbsp;The previous amendment to this User Agreement was effective for all users on September 7, 2010. </p>
                <p style=""><b class="boldTxt">Please be advised: This User Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims you and we have against each other are resolved (see Limitation of Liability and Legal Disputes Sections below).&nbsp; It also contains an Agreement to Arbitrate, which will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us to binding and final arbitration, unless you opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate (see Legal Disputes, Section B ("Agreement to Arbitrate")).&nbsp; Unless you opt-out: (1) you will only be permitted to pursue claims against eBay on an individual basis, not as part of any class or representative action or proceeding and (2) you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.</b></p><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Scope</h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Before you may become a member of eBay, you must read and accept all of the terms in, and linked to, this User Agreement and the eBay Privacy Policy. &nbsp;We strongly recommend that, as you read this User Agreement, you also access and read the linked information. &nbsp;By accepting this User Agreement, you agree that this User Agreement and Privacy Policy will apply whenever you use eBay sites or services, or when you use the tools that are made available to interact with eBay sites and services. &nbsp;Some eBay sites, services, and tools may have additional or other terms, agreements, or policies that govern their availability and use.&nbsp; Your use of and access to such sites, services, and tools are subject to any and all terms, agreements, or policies applicable to them. </p>

                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Buyers and sellers share the responsibility for making sure purchases made on eBay are exciting, rewarding and hassle-free. &nbsp;We strongly encourage buyers to work with sellers before opening a claim relating to a purchase. &nbsp;Buyers and sellers agree to follow the requirements of the eBay Buyer Protection Policy with respect to claims made under eBay's Buyer Protection Policy. &nbsp;eBay Buyer Protection covers only claims filed&nbsp;in accordance with the&nbsp;eBay Buyer Protection Policy, not claims filed with PayPal. eBay Buyer Protection will not cover claims for which the buyer has initiated another form of resolution processing, including credit card chargebacks (if the buyer paid by credit card) or PayPal Buyer Protection claims (if the buyer paid by PayPal).&nbsp; We may suspend the eBay Buyer Protection Policy without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the program.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">We require eBay sellers to comply with our Buyer Protection resolution process. &nbsp;Buyers and sellers permit us to make a final decision, in our sole discretion, on any claim that a buyer files with eBay under the eBay Buyer Protection Policy. &nbsp;If we resolve a dispute in the buyer's favor, we will refund the buyer up to the full cost of the item (including any applicable sales taxes) and the original shipping, and we will require the seller to reimburse us for the amount due to the buyer. &nbsp;Without limiting the foregoing, sellers may not have to reimburse us for an eBay Buyer Protection claim if they provide the documentation (for example, delivery confirmation or proof that the item was as described) indicated in the <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/buyer-protection.html">eBay Buyer Protection Policy</a>. &nbsp;In addition:</p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 6px;"><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">Sellers must have a reimbursement method on file with eBay. </p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">Sellers agree to allow us to remove funds from their PayPal accounts&nbsp;for amounts due to buyers. &nbsp;Sellers may change this reimbursement method by <a href="http://ocs.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ContactCS&amp;query=Change+reimbursement+method&amp;from=UA" target="_blank">contacting eBay</a>. However,&nbsp;we reserve the right to&nbsp;continue using seller PayPal accounts for eBay Buyer Protection cases associated with eBay transactions paid for before the change.</p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">Where there are insufficient funds in PayPal accounts or where PayPal is not the reimbursement method of a seller, we will require another reimbursement method.</p></div></li><li class="unorderedList"><div style="padding-left:4px;"><p style="">Sellers agree to allow us to charge the payment method they designate for amounts due buyers.</p></div></li></ul>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Changing a reimbursement method will not affect eBay's use of a payment method on file for other purposes (such as payment of your eBay fees).&nbsp; If sellers do not provide eBay with a valid reimbursement method, we may collect amounts owed using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.&nbsp; We may also suspend or restrict sellers from buying or selling on our sites and using our services and tools until payment is made.</p>

                <p style="margin-top:0px;">To protect against the risk of liability, eBay has at times requested, and may continue to request, that PayPal hold seller funds based on certain factors, including, but not limited to, selling history, seller performance,&nbsp;riskiness of the&nbsp;listing category, or the filing of an eBay Buyer Protection claim. &nbsp;PayPal has held, and will continue to hold, seller funds pursuant to the terms of the PayPal User Agreement, PayPal policies and any other agreement entered into between PayPal and its users.</p>
                <h3 class="sectionTtl1">Cross-Border Trade</h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Many of our sites, services, and tools are accessible to international sellers and buyers.&nbsp; We may offer certain programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools.</p>
                <p style="">Some eBay members may reside outside of the United States and some may not speak English as a primary language.&nbsp; To assist users who speak different languages, we may translate listings and other eBay content, in whole or in part, into other languages.&nbsp; If you are a seller, you may be able to opt out of our automated translation of your listings by, depending on the site, service, or tool involved, using the functionality built into such site, service, or tool.&nbsp; We also may provide you with access to third party tool(s) so you can request an on-demand translation of certain content on our sites, such as parts of a listing or a message from an eBay user.&nbsp; If you request an on-demand translation from a third party tool, the accuracy or availability of the resulting translation is not guaranteed and will be your sole responsibility.&nbsp; In the event that any on-demand translation of a listing, message or other content conflicts with the meaning of the original text, then the original text will control as the official version of the listing, message or other content, as applicable.</p>
                <p style="">In some cases, you may be able to sell your items internationally by listing items for sale directly on one or more of eBay's international sites.&nbsp; Using various tools, services, and experiences, we may display your&nbsp;listing on an eBay site other than the eBay site where you listed your item for sale, including those situations where you choose to list items with an international shipping option (such as worldwide shipping).&nbsp; However, you may restrict international buyers from purchasing your items if you explicitly exclude international shipping locations from your listings by creating and applying an exclusion list to your listings.&nbsp; If your item is sold to a buyer on an eBay site other than your eBay site of registration, you agree to be subject to that other site's policies and the terms and conditions in eBay's <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/globalCBT/globalCBTAgreement.html" target="_blank">International Selling Agreement</a>.&nbsp; You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the sale and shipment of items to international buyers.</p><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Fees and Services </h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Joining eBay and bidding on listed items is free. &nbsp;We do charge fees for using other services, such as listing items. &nbsp;The fees we charge for using our services are listed on our <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html">Fees schedule</a>, which we may change from time to time. &nbsp;Changes to that schedule are effective after we provide you with at least fourteen days' notice by posting the changes on www.ebay.com. &nbsp;We may choose to temporarily change the fees for our services for promotional events (for example, free listing days) or new services, and such changes are effective when we post the temporary promotional event or new service on the sites.</p>
                <p style="">Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in United States Dollars. &nbsp;You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with our sites, services, and tools with a valid payment method by the <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/payment-due-date.html">payment due date</a>. &nbsp;If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms. &nbsp;(This includes charging other payment methods on file with us, retaining collection agencies and legal counsel, and for accounts over 180 days past due, deducting the amount owed from your PayPal account balance.) &nbsp;In addition, you will be subject to <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html#requirements">late fees</a> and we may suspend or restrict you from using our sites, services, and tools until full payment is made.&nbsp; eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.&nbsp; If you wish to dispute the information eBay reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at eBay Inc., C/O Global Collections, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your eBay account, you must contact the collection agency directly. </p>

                <p style="">You understand and agree that eBay may, without further notice or warning and in its discretion, monitor or record telephone conversations you or anyone acting on your behalf has with eBay or its agents for quality control and training purposes or for its own protection. &nbsp;You acknowledge and understand that, while your communications with eBay may be overheard, monitored, or recorded without further notice or warning, not all telephone lines or calls may be recorded by eBay, and eBay does not guarantee that recordings of any particular telephone calls will be retained or retrievable.</p><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Content </h3>

                <p style="margin-top:0px;">eBay's sites contain robot exclusion headers. &nbsp;Information on our sites is subject to constant updates and changes.&nbsp; Much of the information on the sites is also proprietary or is licensed to eBay by our users or third parties. &nbsp;You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means to access our sites for any purpose without our express handwritten permission. </p>

                <p style="margin-top:0px;">By listing an item on eBay's sites, you agree to pay eBay's fees, to assume full responsibility for the content of the listing and item offered, and to accept the following listing conditions: When you list an item on eBay's sites, your listing will be posted on eBay's sites and can be viewed in My eBay. &nbsp;Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances), so eBay can't guarantee exact listing durations. eBay's <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-multi.html">duplicate listing policy</a> may also affect whether your listing appears in search results. &nbsp;Where your listing appears in search and browse results may be based on certain factors including, but not limited to, listing format, title, bidding activity, end time, keywords, price and shipping cost, feedback, and detailed seller ratings. &nbsp;You can read more about where your listings appear in search and browse results in eBay's Help Pages.</p>
                <h3 class="sectionTtl1">Purchase Conditions</h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">You are responsible for reading the full item listing, including any instructions the seller provides, before making a bid or commitment to buy.&nbsp; Unless otherwise stated, by making a bid or commitment to buy an item on eBay, you are committing to buy the item from the seller listing the item.&nbsp; If you make a commitment to buy or your bid is the winning bid or is otherwise accepted, you enter into a legally binding contract with the seller and are obligated to purchase the item.&nbsp; For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller.&nbsp; </p>
                <p style="">We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.&nbsp; Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code § 2-401(2) apply to the transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise.</p><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Privacy</h3>

                        <p style="">Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. &nbsp;Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.&nbsp; However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.&nbsp; An arbitrator also must follow the terms of this User Agreement as a court would.</p>
                        <p style="">The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.&nbsp; The AAA's rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>.&nbsp; A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at http://www.adr.org.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="">The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.&nbsp; If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or eBay may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and eBay subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.&nbsp; Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or eBay, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p style="">The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different eBay users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law.&nbsp; The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>

                        <p style="">Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.&nbsp; If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all filling, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.&nbsp; Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.&nbsp; If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, eBay will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.&nbsp; In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>
