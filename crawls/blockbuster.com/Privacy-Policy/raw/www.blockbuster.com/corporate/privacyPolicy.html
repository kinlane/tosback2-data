Categories of personal information that we collect include, for example:</p><ul class="discTabList"><li>Basic identifying information such as e-mail address and first and last names</li><li>Security information such as password, secret question and answer or driver's license</li><li>Contact information such as address and phone number</li><li>Store membership information such as membership number, names of others allowed to use your account and favorite stores</li><li>Billing information such as credit or check card, expiration date, billing address and account history</li><li>Site preferences such as movie categories you like, game platforms you have and whether you wish for cover art to be displayed</li><li>Ratings and reviews of movies and games</li><li>Lists of movies and games, such as for online subscription, rental or purchase</li><li>E-newsletter selections and preferences</li><li>Direct marketing contact preferences</li><li>Rental and purchase history</li><li>Sweepstakes entries</li><li>Complaints, questions and information submitted to customer service agents or similar individuals either in person, by phone, by e-mail or by entry on a Site</li><li>Site behavior such as pages visited or searches requested</li><li>Browser information such as browser version, connection speed, IP address and the presence of various related plug-ins and tools such as media players</li></ul></dd><dt><a name="collect">&nbsp;</a>When Does Blockbuster Collect Personal Information?</dt><dd><p>Blockbuster collects personal information from you when you voluntarily submit that information to Blockbuster, for example: when you apply for a customer membership in our stores; register on a Site; sign up for a subscription service; register for our e-newsletter service; participate in one of our sweepstakes, contests, or surveys; respond to an offer; purchase or rent products; or request to be on a mailing list. After you have registered your e-mail address on the Site and if you have clicked "Remember Me" or signed in to the Site, Blockbuster collects Site behavior and browser information as you navigate through the Site. This information may be used to create a profile that we keep on individual Users that details their preferences, personal information and behavior. Consequently, collected information is tied to the User's personally identifiable information and may be used to provide offers and improve the content of the Site for the User. This profile may also be used to tailor a User's visit to our Web Site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.</p><p>We may also collect personal information from other sources. For example, we purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing databases of User and Member information to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our Users and Members would be interested in. We use this information to enhance or overlay the 'profile' of individual Users. This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to the User's or Member's personally identifiable information. </p></dd><dt><a name="register">&nbsp;</a>What Happens When I Register On The Web Site?</dt><dd><p>In order to use certain features of this Web Site, a User must first complete a registration process. During registration a User is required to provide basic contact information (such as name and e-mail address) and establish a password. Depending on the feature being used, the User may be required to provide other information associated with the use of that particular feature. For example, a User signing up for our subscription service will be required to provide an address to which products will be mailed and financial information in the form of a credit card or check card number and expiration date for billing purposes. Users signing up for our e-newsletter service may enter the types of movies or games in which they are interested and about which they wish to receive information in the newsletter.</p></dd><dt><a name="order">&nbsp;</a>What Happens When I Place An Order On The Web Site?</dt><dd><p>Certain features of the Web Site do not require registration but may still require personal information to be entered, such as placing an order for a product. We request information from the User during the ordering process. For example, a User will be required to provide contact information (such as name, e-mail, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card or check card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill Users' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the User.</p></dd><dt><a name="cookie">&nbsp;</a>Does Blockbuster Use Cookie Technology?</dt><dd><p>Blockbuster uses cookie technology to make your use of the Sites more convenient and to support our internal business purposes. A cookie is a piece of information that is transferred to a User's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. For example, Blockbuster uses cookies to remember your e-mail address so that you will not have to re-enter this information each time you visit the Site. Blockbuster also uses cookies to help track referrals from third party web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can set up your browser to alert you every time a cookie is offered, letting you decide whether or not to accept it. You can use and visit the Site with cookies disabled, but you will not automatically be recognized by the Site upon re-visiting. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our Sites' best features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on. </p><p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our Site (for example, advertising partners). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies.</p></dd><dt><a name="other">&nbsp;</a>What Other Mechanisms Does Blockbuster Use to Track User Behavior?</dt><dd><p>Some Site web pages and HTML-formatted e-mails and e-newsletters use web beacons to compile statistics about Web Site usage. A web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. You may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies. </p><p>Blockbuster and its third party vendors use web beacons to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage information and to compile statistical information about our Users in order to improve the Web Site's quality and to support our business. All data collected on behalf of Blockbuster is owned and used by Blockbuster. Blockbuster reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Web Site visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for business partners.</p><p>We also collect information in log files that include data such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We and our business partners use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track User's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. </p></dd><dt><a name="children">&nbsp;</a>How Does Blockbuster Handle Information from Children?</dt><dd><p>Please note that Blockbuster has no intention of collecting personal information from individuals under the age of 13 ("children"). We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

In addition, Blockbuster, its subsidiaries and franchisees may share and use information collected through the Site to administer and manage our business, including, for example for account maintenance and collections purposes, and in connection with information technology services. In addition, personal information may be used to create a profile that we keep on individual Users that details their preferences and behavior. This profile may be used to develop and improve the products, benefits and services, Blockbuster, its subsidiaries, franchisees and business partners offer to our Members or Users, to improve the Site and the associated user experience, and to develop pertinent marketing promotions to Users and Members. </p><p>Where permitted or required by law, Blockbuster may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent, for example in response to a court order or subpoena or to comply with a legally permitted inquiry by a government agency. </p></dd><dt><a name="contacted">&nbsp;</a>When Will I Be Contacted by Blockbuster?</dt><dd><p>You may receive products and communications associated with your transactions with Blockbuster, such as rentals, purchases, subscriptions, sweepstakes and contests. You may also receive communications from Blockbuster related to transactions that appear to be from you or which appear to be fraudulent. You may be contacted in regards to an issue on your account or in response to a customer service contact by you or in response to a specific request from you such as clicking on a "forgot my password" link. Users who sign up for e-newsletter subscriptions will receive e-mails in accordance with their selection and preferences. These administrative communications also may be accompanied by information about products and services, special offers and upcoming promotions or events offered by Blockbuster, our subsidiaries, our franchisees or our marketing partners that we think may be of interest to you ("direct marketing"). </p><p>You may periodically receive from Blockbuster, its subsidiaries and franchisees unsolicited direct marketing communications by mail (delivered via the United States Postal Service). Blockbuster and its subsidiaries will send standalone direct marketing e-mail communications to you only if you have agreed previously.

For example, Blockbuster uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card or check card number, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. </p></dd><dt><a name="links">&nbsp;</a>What About Links to Other Web Sites?</dt><dd><p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Blockbuster. However, our Site contains links to other web sites owned and operated by third parties. The third parties who operate these sites may treat the collection, use and disclosure of personal information differently than we do. This could be the case even for those web sites that carry Blockbuster's or its affiliates' trademarks or logos or which are framed by a Site. Please be aware that Blockbuster is not responsible for the data collection, use and disclosure practices of companies or organizations to which our Sites may provide links. We encourage our Users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. </p></dd><dt><a name="reviews">&nbsp;</a>Posting Reviews to the Web Site</dt><dd><p>If you are a registered user of this Web Site, writing a review gives you an opportunity to voice your take on a movie or game. By posting a review you acknowledge that your first name and the first initial of your last name will be used in connection with your review. Blockbuster discourages you from including any other personally identifiable information in your review. However, Blockbuster does not edit reviews to remove such information. It is important to remember that once you post your review, all information contained in your review, including your name, is made available on www.blockbuster.com for other consumers to read. In addition, search engines and other internet websites may access certain information that is posted on www.blockbuster.com and provide that information to their users. In addition, Blockbuster may make reviews available for display on portals and other third party websites that support the purchase, rental or download of videos or games from Blockbuster. For example, a consumer who conducts a search for reviews of a particular movie or game on a search engine website or on a shopping site may be presented with reviews from www.blockbuster.com. </p></dd><dt><a name="correct">&nbsp;</a>How Can I Access or Correct My Personal Information?</dt><dd><p>If a User's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if a User no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or deactivate Users' personally identifiable information.
