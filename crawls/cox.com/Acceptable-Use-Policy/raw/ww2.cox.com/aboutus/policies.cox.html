<p class="txtTitleA">CoxCom, LLC and its affiliates and/or distribution partners (collectively "Cox") are pleased that you have chosen Cox&reg; High Speed Internet SM service (the "Service"). Our goal is to provide you and our other subscribers with an enriched, high quality Internet experience. This Acceptable Use Policy (the "AUP") has been designed to protect our Service, our subscribers, and the Internet community from inappropriate, illegal or otherwise objectionable activities. Please read this policy prior to accessing the Service. All users of the Service must abide by this AUP. Violation of any term of this AUP may result in the immediate suspension or termination of either your access to the Service and/or your Cox account. This AUP should be read in conjunction with the Cox High Speed Internet Subscriber Agreement, Privacy Policies, and other applicable policies.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA">By using the Service, you agree to abide by, and require others using the Service via your account to abide by the terms of this AUP. The AUP will be updated from time to time, so you should consult this document regularly to ensure that your activities conform to the most recent version. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY STOP THE USE OF THE SERVICES AND NOTIFY THE COX CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT SO THAT YOUR ACCOUNT MAY BE CLOSED.</p>
<p><strong>1. Prohibited Activities</strong>. You may not use the Service in a manner that violates any applicable local, state, federal or international law, order or regulation. Additionally, you may not use the Service to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="txtTitleA">Harm to Minors. You may not use the Service to harm or attempt to harm a minor, including, but not limited to, hosting, possessing, distributing, or transmitting child pornography or other material that is unlawful.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="txtTitleA">Conduct, participate in, or otherwise facilitate, pyramid or other illegal soliciting schemes.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="txtTitleA">Take part in any fraudulent activities, including impersonating any person or entity or forging anyone else's digital or manual signature.</div>

<div class="txtTitleA">Invade another person's privacy, stalk, harass, or otherwise violate the rights of others.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="txtTitleA">Post, transmit, or distribute content that is illegal, threatening, abusive, libelous, slanderous, defamatory, promotes violence, or is otherwise offensive or objectionable in Cox&rsquo;s sole discretion.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="txtTitleA">Restrict, inhibit, or otherwise interfere with the ability of any other person to use or enjoy their equipment or the Service, including, without limitation, by posting or transmitting any information or software which contains a virus, lock, key, bomb, worm, Trojan botnet, cancelbot, or other harmful feature.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="txtTitleA">Access or use the Service with an IP address other than the dynamic Internet Protocol ("IP") address assigned to you which adheres to dynamic host configuration protocol ("DHCP"). You may not configure the Service or any related equipment to access or use a static IP address or use any protocol other than DHCP.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="txtTitleA">Modify any cable modem connected to the Cox network, regardless of whether the modem is owned by you or leased from Cox, in order to commit theft of the Service, fraudulently use the Service or provide the Service to a third party.

</li>
</ul>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>2. Intellectual Property Infringement</strong>. You may not use the Service to post, copy, transmit, or disseminate any content that infringes the patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademark, moral rights, or propriety rights of any party. Cox assumes no responsibility, and you assume all risk regarding the determination of whether material is in the public domain, or may otherwise be used by you for such purposes.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>3. User Content</strong>. You are solely responsible for any information that is transmitted from your IP address or your account on the web or other Internet services. You must ensure that the recipient of the content is appropriate and must take appropriate precautions to prevent minors from receiving inappropriate content. Cox reserves the right to refuse to post or to remove any information or materials from the Service, in whole or in part, that Cox deems, in its sole discretion, to be illegal, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>4. Commercial Use</strong>. The Service is designed for personal, non-business related use of the Internet and may not be used for commercial purposes. You may not resell the Service or otherwise make the Service available for use to persons outside your dwelling (for example, through an open wireless home network). You agree not to use the Service for operation as a de facto Internet service provider, or for any other business enterprise (whether for profit or non-profit), including, without limitation, IP address translation or similar facilities intended to provide additional access. For commercial Internet service please contact Cox Business.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>5. Servers</strong>. You may not operate, or allow others to operate, servers of any type or any other device, equipment, and/or software providing server-like functionality in connection with the Service, unless expressly authorized by Cox.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>6. Misuse of Service</strong>. You may be held responsible for any misuse of the Service that occurs through your account or IP address, even if the misuse was inadvertent. You must therefore take precautions to ensure that others do not gain unauthorized access to the Service or misuse the Service, including conduct in violation of this AUP.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>7. Hacking/Attempted Unauthorized Access</strong>. You may not use the Service to breach or attempt to breach the security of another user or attempt to gain access to any organization or person's computer, software, or data without the knowledge and consent of such person. The equipment and the Service may not be used in any attempt to circumvent the user authentication or security of any host, network or account. This includes, but is not limited to, accessing data not intended for you, logging into or making use of a server or account you are not expressly authorized to access, or probing the security of other networks or computers for any reason. Use or distribution of tools for compromising security, such as password guessing programs, cracking tools, packet sniffers or network probing tools, is prohibited.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>8. Security</strong>. You are solely responsible for the security of any device connected to the Service, including any data stored on that device. You are responsible for implementing appropriate security precautions for all systems connected to the Service to protect against threats such as viruses, spam, Trojan botnets, and other malicious intrusions. You are responsible for enabling the security of any wireless (Wi-Fi) networks connected to the Service. Any wireless network installed by the customer or a Cox representative that is unsecured or "open" and connected to the Cox network is prohibited. You authorize Cox to use technology to detect unsecured wireless networks associated with your use of the Service. If Cox determines that you are using the Service via an unsecured wireless network, Cox will notify you to enable the Security on the Wi-Fi device.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>9. Disruption of Service.</strong> You may not disrupt the Service in any manner. You shall not interfere with computer networking or telecommunications services to any user, host or network, including, without limitation, denial of service attacks, flooding of a network, overloading a service, improper seizing and abuse of operator privileges or attempts to "crash" a host.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>10. Viruses, Trojan Horses, Worms and Denial of Service Attacks.</strong> Software or other content downloaded from the Service may contain viruses and it is your sole responsibility to take appropriate precautions to protect your computer from damage to its software, files and data. You are prohibited from posting, transmitting or disseminating any information or software that contains a virus, Trojan horse, spambot, worm or other harmful program or that generates levels of traffic sufficient to impede others' ability to send or retrieve information. Prohibited conduct of this type includes denial of service attacks or similarly disruptive transmissions, as well as transmissions containing other harmful or malicious features. We may suspend the Service without prior notice if we detect a harmful program such as a virus infection. Your service will be resumed once the harmful program is removed.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>11. Email.</strong> You may not use the Service to send bulk, commercial or unsolicited ("spam") email messages. Any unsolicited email, originating from any source, must not direct recipients to any website that is part of our Service, such as personal web pages, or other resources that are part of the Service. The Service may not be used to collect responses from unsolicited email sent from accounts on other Internet hosts or email services that violate this Policy or the acceptable use policy of any other Internet service provider. In addition, "mail bombing," the sending of numerous copies of the same or substantially similar messages or very large messages or files with the intent to disrupt a server or account, is prohibited.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA">You may not reference Cox in the header or body of an unsolicited email, or list an IP address that belongs to the Cox network in any unsolicited email. Further, you may not take any action which implies that Cox is the sponsor of any unsolicited email even if that email is not sent through the Cox network. Further, forging, altering or removing electronic mail headers is prohibited.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA">If the Service is disconnected, whether voluntarily or by termination, all user names and associated electronic email addresses may be immediately released for reuse. Upon disconnection, any mailbox contents may be immediately deleted or held in a locked state. Addresses and email may be held until Cox deletes them as part of its normal policies and procedures. There is no obligation for Cox to retain or make any user name, email address or stored email retrievable once the Service is disconnected.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>12. Bandwidth, Data Storage and Other Limitations</strong>. Cox offers multiple packages of Service with varying speeds, features and data usage allowances (not all packages are available in all areas). You must comply with the current bandwidth, data storage, email limits and other requirements associated with the package of Service you selected. Information on speeds, usage and other features can be found at&nbsp;<a title="http://ww2.cox.com/policies/speedsusage.cox" href="http://ww2.cox.com/aboutus/policies/speedsusage.cox">Speeds and&nbsp;Usage Information</a>. You must ensure that your activities do not improperly restrict, inhibit, or degrade any other user's use of the Service, nor represent (in Cox&rsquo;s sole judgment) an unusually great burden on the network itself. In addition, you must ensure that your use does not improperly restrict, inhibit, disrupt, degrade or impede Cox's ability to deliver the Service and monitor the Service, backbone, network nodes, and/or other network services. If your bandwidth usage exceeds the amount included in your Internet package, Cox may suspend the Service or require you to upgrade the Service to a higher package and/or pay additional fees. In rare cases, Cox may terminate your Service if you have not reduced your bandwidth usage after consultation with Cox.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>13.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Conflict</strong>. In the event of a conflict between the Subscriber Agreement and this AUP, the terms of the Subscriber Agreement will prevail.</p>
<p class="txtTitleA"><strong>14. How to Contact Cox</strong>. For any questions regarding this AUP, complaints of violations, or cancellation notices, please contact Cox at one of the following:</p>

<p><strong>4. Computer and Equipment Requirements<br /></strong>Your computer equipment must comply with Cox's current minimum computer requirements that are available on <a href="http://ww2.cox.com/residential/support.cox">http://ww2.cox.com/residential/support.cox</a>. The minimum computer requirements may change and Cox will make reasonable efforts to support previously acceptable configurations; however, Cox is not obligated to continue to provide such support. You may rent or purchase a cable modem from Cox or may purchase a DOCSIS-compliant, Cox-approved cable modem from a third party retailer. Cox reserves the right to provide service only to users with Cox-approved DOCSIS-compliant modems. Please check with local Cox Customer Support or online at <a href="http://ww2.cox.com/residential/support.cox">http://ww2.cox.com/residential/support.cox</a> for the most current Cox approved cable modem list. You agree to connect only Cox approved equipment to the Cox network.</p>
<p>You will not remove any Cox owned equipment (the "Equipment") from the Premises or connect the Equipment to any outlet other than the outlet to which the Equipment was initially connected by the Cox installer. Cox may relocate the Equipment for you within the Premises at your request for an additional charge. If you relocate to a new address, this Agreement may terminate, you may be required to enter into a new Agreement and may be charged a new installation fee to initiate Service. You will not connect any equipment, other than equipment authorized by Cox, to the cable modem outlet. You understand that failure to comply with this restriction may cause damage to the Cox network and subject you to liability for damages and/or criminal prosecution. You may not alter, modify or tamper with the Equipment or the Service, or permit any other person to do the same that is not authorized by Cox.</p>
<p><strong>5. Installation</strong><br />Cox shall use reasonable efforts to install the Service to full operational status, provided that your computer fulfills the minimum computer requirements set forth herein. You authorize Cox personnel and/or its agents to enter your premises (the "Premises") at mutually agreed upon times in order to install, maintain, inspect, repair and remove the Service.

In addition, if actual damages cannot be reasonably calculated, you agree to pay Cox liquidated damages of five dollars (U.S. $5.00) for each piece of "spam" or unsolicited bulk email transmitted from or otherwise connected with your account. Otherwise you agree to pay Cox's actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Cox reserves the right to block, reject or remove what it considers in its sole discretion to be "spam" or other unsolicited bulk email from the Service and Cox shall have no liability for blocking or removing any email considered to be "spam."</p>
<p><strong>12. Termination and Surviving Obligations<br /></strong>Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause by providing the other party with no less than twenty-four (24) hours written notice of such termination. In the event of termination by you, you must notify Cox by telephone or by a non-electronic written submission. Email submissions shall not constitute effective notice. In the event of termination by Cox, Cox may notify you of such termination by electronic or other means. In those cases where you elect annual prepayment terms, you agree and understand that the calculation of any refund for unused Service will be based upon the normal rate for the Service and not upon the discounted annual prepayment rate.</p>
<p>You expressly agree that upon termination of this Agreement: (i) You will pay Cox in full for your use of any Equipment and Service up to the later of the effective date of termination of this Agreement or the date on which the Service and any Equipment have been disconnected and returned to Cox. You agree to pay Cox on a pro-rated basis for any use by you of any Equipment or Services for a part of a month. (ii) You will permit Cox to access your premises at a reasonable time to remove any Equipment and other material provided by Cox. (iii) You will ensure the immediate return of any Equipment to Cox.

Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability<br /></strong>You expressly agree that Cox is not responsible or liable for any content, act or omission of any third party including, without limitation, any threatening, defamatory, obscene, offensive, or illegal conduct, or any infringement of another's rights including, without limitation, privacy and intellectual property rights, and you hereby release Cox for any such claims based on the activities of third parties. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. NEITHER COX, NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS WARRANT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL MALICIOUS AGENTS EVEN IF ANTI-VIRUS MECHANISMS ARE DEPLOYED.

COX AND ITS EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES AND AGENTS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY COSTS OR DAMAGES, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM THE INSTALLATION OR USE OF, THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, THE SERVICE (INCLUDING EMAIL), EQUIPMENT FURNISHED BY COX, OR COX'S PROVISION OF TECHNICAL SERVICE AND SUPPORT FOR THE SERVICE; EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGE RESULTS FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF A COX INSTALLER, TECHNICIAN, OR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE, INCLUDING ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT COX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY EVENT, COX'S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE USE OF THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SERVICE FEES PAID DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. YOU HEREBY RELEASE COX FROM ANY AND ALL OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITIES, AND CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF THIS LIMITATION. COX IS ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR ANY COSTS OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT. Your sole and exclusive remedies under this Agreement are as expressly set forth herein.

<p><strong>14. Indemnification<br /></strong>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Cox, its officers, directors, employees, parent companies, subsidiaries, members, affiliates, suppliers, and agents, from any claim, demand, or damage, including costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, asserted by Cox or any third party due to or arising out of your use of or conduct on the Service. Cox will notify you within a reasonable period of time of any third party claim for which Cox seeks indemnification and will afford you the opportunity to participate in the defense of such claim, provided that your participation will not be conducted in a manner prejudicial to Cox's interests, as reasonably determined by Cox.</p>
<p><strong>15. Management of Network<br /></strong>Cox is committed to the ongoing management of its network to improve its service offerings, protect customers, and create new Services and feature enhancements for its customers. Cox does not shape or throttle Internet traffic based on the particular online content, protocols or applications a customer uses. Cox uses other measures to ensure the best overall experience for our CHSI customers, including, without limitation: rate limiting of email (as set forth in our email policies), email storage limits (including deletion of dormant or unchecked email), rejection or removal of "spam" or otherwise unsolicited bulk email, and data usage allowances. Cox also employs other means to protect customers, children, and its network, including blocking access to child pornography (based upon lists of sites provided by a third party and an international police agency), and security measures (including identification and blocking of botnets, viruses, phishing sites, malware, and certain ports as set forth below).</p>
<p>Cox may take any appropriate measures, whether or not they are described above, in response to extraordinary levels of usage, denial of service attacks, or other exigent circumstances that have a significant effect on our subscribers&rsquo; ability to obtain service or Cox&rsquo;s ability to provide service.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>19. Governing Law<br /></strong>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the state in which your billing address in our records is located, and applicable federal law.</p>
<p><strong>20. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.<br />YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION (EXCEPT ITS JURY TRIAL WAIVER) WITHIN 30 DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THIS AGREEMENT, IF YOU FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN SECTION 20.7 BELOW. OTHERWISE, YOU WILL BE BOUND TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTES YOU MAY HAVE WITH COX THROUGH THE FOLLOWING DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES.</strong></p>
<p><strong>20.1&nbsp;YOU AND COX AGREE TO ARBITRATE &ndash; RATHER THAN LITIGATE IN COURT &ndash; any and all claims or disputes between us (including any parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or agents of Cox) that arise out of or in any way relate to: (1) this Agreement; (2) services that Cox provides to you in connection with this Agreement; (3) products that Cox makes available to you; (4) bills that Cox sends to you or amounts that Cox charges you for services or goods provided under this Agreement; and (5) any services or goods that Cox or any of its affiliated entities provide to you under any other agreement; provided, however, that in no event, shall this provision prevent you from filing or joining a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission or any state public service commission or public utility commission that has jurisdiction to hear such complaint, or any federal, state, or local government agency that is authorized by law to seek relief against Cox on your behalf. The arbitration between you and Cox will be binding and judgment on the award rendered in the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</strong></p>
<p><strong>20.2</strong>&nbsp;In arbitration, there is no judge and no jury, and review of arbitration decisions in the courts is very limited. Instead, our disputes will be resolved by an arbitrator, whose authority is governed by the terms of this Agreement. You and Cox agree that an arbitrator may only award such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could award, limited to the same extent as a court would limit relief pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. An arbitrator may award attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs if a court would be authorized to do so, and may issue injunctive or declaratory relief if that relief is required or authorized by the applicable law, but that injunctive or declaratory relief may not extend beyond you and your dealings with Cox. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court. Notwithstanding this arbitration agreement, you and Cox may bring appropriate claims against each other in small claims court, if the claims fall within the small claims court&rsquo;s jurisdiction, or before the Federal Communications Commission, the relevant state public utilities commission, or any other federal, state, or local government agency authorized by law to hear your claims.</p>
<p><strong>20.3&nbsp;Class Action Waiver:</strong> You and Cox agree that all claims or disputes between you and Cox will be arbitrated individually, and that there will be no class, representative, or consolidated actions in arbitration. If you or Cox brings a claim in small claims court, the class action waiver will apply, and neither of us can bring a claim on a class or representative basis. Furthermore, neither you nor Cox may participate in a class or representative action as a class member if the class action asserts claims that would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if they were directly asserted by you or Cox. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this arbitration agreement shall not prohibit you or Cox from participating in any judgment or settlement in any litigation brought by a federal, state, or local government on behalf of you or us, excluding litigation brought by any relator or party in its capacity as a private attorney general. We both agree that this class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and that if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by any court or arbitrator then the entire arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 20 will not apply to any claim or dispute between you and Cox, except for the provisions of Section 20.6 waiving the right to jury trial. This class action waiver may not be severed from our arbitration agreement.</p>
<p><strong>20.4 Informal Dispute Resolution:</strong> You and Cox agree that you will try to resolve disputes informally before resorting to arbitration. If the dispute cannot be resolved by telephone, you agree to notify Cox of the dispute by sending a written description of your claim to Cox Customer Care, ATTN: Corporate Escalation Team, 1400 Lake Hearn Drive NE, Atlanta, GA, 30319 so that Cox can attempt to resolve it with you. If Cox does not satisfactorily resolve your claim within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of it, then you may pursue the claim in arbitration. Neither you nor Cox may initiate arbitration without first providing the other notice of the claim and following the informal dispute resolution procedure provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>20.5&nbsp;Arbitration Procedures:</strong> You and Cox agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies. All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA"). The AAA&rsquo;s rules are available on its website at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply. If the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. If there is a conflict between the AAA's rules and this dispute resolution agreement, this dispute resolution agreement shall control. To initiate arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claims to Cox Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 1400 Lake Hearn Drive NE, Atlanta, GA, 30319. You must also comply with the AAA's rules regarding initiation of arbitration. Cox will pay all filing fees and costs for commencement of an arbitration, but you will be responsible for your own attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator pursuant to the terms of this agreement or applicable law. Cox will not seek to recover its fees and costs from you in the arbitration unless your claim has been determined to be frivolous. If you are successful in the arbitration, Cox will pay your reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs. If you obtain an award from the arbitrator greater than Cox&rsquo;s last written settlement offer, Cox will pay you $5,000 in addition to what you have been awarded in the arbitration. The arbitration will be held in a mutually convenient location. If you seek less than $10,000, then you may chose to hold the arbitration in person, via phone, or to have it decided based on written submissions. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>20.6&nbsp;Jury Trial Waiver:</strong> If for any reason this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, including without limitation, that the class waiver is found unenforceable, or if you opt out of this dispute resolution agreement, you and Cox expressly and knowingly WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. This means that a Judge rather than a Jury will decide disputes between you and Cox if, for any reason, the arbitration agreement is not enforced.</p>
<p><strong>20.7 Opt Out:</strong> You may opt out of this dispute resolution provision (except for the jury trial waiver contained in Section 20.6 above) by notifying Cox of that intent within 30 days of the date of this Subscriber Agreement for current customers. For new customers activating Service after the date of this Subscriber Agreement, you may opt out by notifying Cox of that intent within 30 days of the date you subscribe to the Service. You may opt out through either of the following options (please include your name, address, and Cox account number on the communication): (1) sending a letter stating your intent to reject this dispute resolution provision to Cox at Cox Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 1400 Lake Hearn Drive NE, Atlanta, GA, 30319; or (2) sending an email with your intent to reject this dispute resolution provision to <a href="mailto:ArbitrationOptOut@cox.com">ArbitrationOptOut@cox.com</a>. Exercising this right, should you choose to do so, will not affect any of the other terms of this Agreement or other contracts with Cox and you may remain a Cox customer. If you opt out of the dispute resolution provision, you will not be required to do so again if Cox modifies this section in the future or you agree to a new term of service.</p>
<p><strong>20.8 Survival:</strong> This dispute resolution provision survives the termination of your contract with Cox. If you bring a claim against Cox after termination of your contract that is based in whole or in part on events or omissions that occurred while you were a Cox customer, this dispute resolution provision shall apply.</p>
<p><strong>21. Miscellaneous<br /></strong><strong>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes and replaces any and all prior written or oral agreements. In the event that any portion of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion shall be construed in accordance with applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties and the remainder of its provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to limit Cox's rights and remedies available at law or in equity. Cox's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by you. This Agreement is freely assignable by Cox to third parties.</strong></p>

If Cox does not provide a modem or backup battery power for Cox Services utilizing a telephone cable modem, you must provide it and it will remain your responsibility in all respects. If (i) the modem that supplies your telephone Service is disconnected or moved, (ii) the backup battery is not charged or otherwise becomes inoperable, or (iii) there is an extended power outage, telephone Service, including access to E911, will not be available. Cox uses your telephone Service address to identify your location for E911 Service. To ensure that E911 dispatch receives your correct address, the telephone modem should not be moved, even inside your home. You must notify Cox in advance if you would like to move or relocate your telephone Service.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> All Cox Equipment and embedded Software (Equipment) provided to You by Cox or its agent will remain the property of Cox. Cox shall have the unrestricted right, but not the obligation, to install or modify the software in any of the Equipment. It is a material breach for You to copy, duplicate, reverse engineer or in any way tamper with or interfere with any Software provided to You by Cox. You also agree:</p>
<ol>
<li>To use the Equipment only for receiving Services ordered from or through Cox. You will only use any modem embedded in a digital video box for the receipt of Cox video Services. </li>
<li>To promptly return the Equipment to Cox in good condition and without any encumbrances, except for ordinary wear and tear resulting from proper use, immediately upon discontinuance of Service. </li>
</ol>
<p>If You do not promptly return the Equipment or if it is damaged or encumbered, (&ldquo;Unreturned Equipment&rdquo;), the damages Cox will incur will be difficult to ascertain. Therefore, You agree to pay, and Cox may charge Your account, a liquidated damages amount equal to Cox&rsquo;s reasonable estimates of the replacement costs and incidental costs that Cox incurs; provided, however, that such amount will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by law (the &ldquo;Unreturned Equipment Charge&rdquo;). This provision and any other provision that by its nature should survive shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Programming:</strong> You acknowledge that Cox reserves the right at any time and in its sole discretion to change its channel lineup and/or to pre-empt specific programs or parts of programs previously advertised as available. Cox also reserves the right to alter its fee structure upon notice to You. You may immediately terminate service upon notice to Cox. You may not rebroadcast, transmit, record, perform, or charge admission to view or listen to any of the programming made available by the Services unless you obtain and pay for any public performance licenses.</p>
<p><strong>LIMITATION OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY: COX, ITS PARENT, AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, (COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY, THE &ldquo;COX GROUP&rdquo;) MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS TO THE EQUIPMENT FURNISHED TO YOU AND/OR SERVICES PROVIDED. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THESE PROVISIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE COX GROUP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO FURNISH, OR THE DEGRADATION OR INTERRUPTION OF ANY SERVICES, FOR ANY LOST DATA OR CONTENT, IDENTITY THEFT, FOR ANY FILES OR SOFTWARE DAMAGE, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE. THE COX GROUP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OR FOR INJURY TO ANY PERSON ARISING FROM THE INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE OR REMOVAL OF EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE, WIRING OR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES. NOR SHALL COX BE LIABLE FOR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SERVICE IF THE CAUSE IS DUE TO THE ACTS OF A THIRD PARTY. YOU HEREBY INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE COX GROUP FROM ANY CLAIMS, ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, DAMAGES AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS&rsquo; FEES, ARISING OUT OF (I) SUCH DAMAGE OR INJURY RESULTING FROM ANY CLAIM THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE INFRINGES ON THE PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT OF ANY THIRD PARTY, (II) ANY BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH BY YOU OF THIS AGREEMENT; OR INJURY TO PERSON OR PROPERTY RESULTING FROM YOUR NEGLIGENCE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE COX GROUP BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. THE COX GROUP&rsquo;S MAXIMUM TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING YOUR CLAIM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breach of Agreement:</strong> If You breach this Agreement, or any other agreement referenced herein, Cox has the right to terminate this Agreement and retrieve its equipment. Cox&rsquo;s failure to require Your strict performance of any term of this Agreement shall not be a waiver of Cox&rsquo;s right to require strict performance of any term or condition herein.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> This Agreement, any applicable tariffs and other agreements specifically referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between Cox and You for the subject matter hereof. Only Cox may make modifications to this document. The invalidity or unenforceability of any term of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA"), you may file a Notification of claimed infringement with the Designated Agent of a Service Provider if you believe that a Web page hosted by the Service Provider is violating your rights under U.S. copyright law. (See Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(3)). The DMCA provides the following procedure for parties to follow who wish to file a Notification of claimed infringement with a Service Provider.</p>
<p>To serve a Notification on Cox<sup>&reg;</sup> Business; Cox<sup>&reg;</sup> High Speed Internet<sup>SM</sup>; and/or Cox Interactive Media<sup>SM</sup>, send your Notification to:</p>
<p><strong>Name of Designated Agent to Receive Notification:</strong> DMCA Agent <br />&nbsp; <br /><strong>Address to Which Notification Should be Sent:</strong> 1400 Lake Hearn Drive, NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30319 <br />&nbsp; <br /><strong>Telephone Number of Designated Agent:</strong> (404) 269-6830 <br /><strong>Facsimile Number of Designated Agent:</strong> (404) 269-8432 <br />&nbsp; <br /><strong>Email Address of Designated Agent:</strong> <a href="mailto:abuse@cox.net">abuse@cox.net</a></p>
<p><strong>Notification:<br /></strong>In order to be effective under the DMCA, the Notification must (i) be in writing, and (ii) provided to the Designated Agent of a Service Provider.</p>
<p>In order for such a complaint to be effective under the DMCA, Notification must include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single Notification, a representative list of such works at that site.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the Service Provider to locate the material.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the Service Provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>A statement that the information in the Notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon receipt of the written Notification containing the information described in 1 through 6 above, Service Provider will:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Remove or disable access to the material that is alleged to be infringing.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Take reasonable steps to promptly notify the subscriber that it has removed or disabled access to the material.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Counter Notification:</strong><br />If a notice of copyright infringement has been filed against you, you may file a Counter Notification with a Service Provider's Designated Agent. In order to be effective, a Counter Notification must be written and include substantially the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>The subscriber's name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber's address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the Service Provider may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided Notification or an agent of such person.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon receipt of a Counter Notification containing the information as outlined in 1 through 4 above, Service Provider shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Promptly provide the complaining party with a copy of the Counter Notification;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Replace the removed material or cease disabling access to the material within 10 to 14 business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless the Service Provider's Designated Agent first receives notice from the complaining party that an action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain alleged infringing party from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Service Provider's system or network.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Under the DMCA, claimants who make misrepresentations concerning copyright infringement may be liable for damages incurred as a result of the removal or blocking of the material, court costs, and attorneys fees. See Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(d).</p>
