<h3><strong><a id="b" name="b"></a>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?</strong></h3>
<p>The information The New York Times gathers falls into two categories: 1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our sites, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and 2) Non-personal information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected as you use the NYT Services.</p>
<p><em><strong>Personal Information That You Give Us</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Registration Information<br /></strong></p>
<p>Registration for the NYT Services requires that you supply certain personal information, including, in most cases, a unique e-mail address and demographic information (ZIP code, age, sex, household income (optional), job industry and job title) to register. Purchases made through the NYT Services require that you supply your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other billing information.</p>
<p>You may choose to log in, create an account or enhance your profile at NYTimes.com through the Facebook Connect feature on NYTimes.com. By doing this, you are asking Facebook to send us certain information from your Facebook profile, and you authorize us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information available to us through the Facebook interface. After you have connected, Facebook also sends us additional information from your profile that allows us to display a Facebook module on the pages you view.</p>
<p>To disassociate your NYTimes.com registration from third party accounts, please see our <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/site/socialmedia/social-media.html#social-fb-howto-disconnect">Social Media FAQ</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Billing and Credit Card Information</strong></p>
<p>To enable payment and donations on the NYT services, we collect and store billing and credit card information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.</p>
<p><strong>User Generated Content and Public Activities (Including Comments, Reader Reviews and TimesPeople)</strong></p>
<p>We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on NYTimes.com and other NYT Services. "Public activities" are any actions you take on NYTimes.com that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reader reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by The New York Times for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these areas, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums and The New York Times has no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your public activities or any of your submissions that are a result of your public activities. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/site/usercontent/usercontent.html">Comments FAQ</a> and read the Forums, Discussions and User Generated Content section of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/agree.html#discussions">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>When you share or recommend (with or without adding your own comments) any NYTimes.com articles or content to your Facebook profile, that action is governed by the Facebook Privacy Policy. We do not track or store a record of those comments or actions.</p>
<p>If you have registered for a NYTimes.com account, we will track and aggregate your public activities on NYTimes.com. By choosing to participate in public activities, you are electing to share and display such public activities via NYTimes.com. Also, public activities may be included in RSS feeds, APIs and made available to other Web sites via other formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other Web sites, blogs, or feeds. Keep in mind that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your public activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not The New York Times. Please see our <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/site/usercontent/usercontent.html">Comments FAQ</a> for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers</strong></p>
<p>The New York Times collects personal information from you in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is also being collected by a third party other than The New York Times, we will notify you at the same time. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.</p>
<p><a id="lab" name="lab"></a><strong>Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research</strong></p>
<p>The New York Times may collect personal information from you in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected through the NYT Services, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide in response to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.</p>
<p>Members of our Reader Panels agree to participate in surveys, polls or discussions about their readership of The New York Times, their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior. If you choose to be a panel member, we require that you supply us with your e-mail address and name. Home address and telephone number are optional. Our panels are currently administered by <a href="http://www.visioncritical.com/">Vision Critical</a> and <a href="http://www.nybeta.com/">Beta Research</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Special Events and Promotions</strong></p>
<p>We often receive information regarding readers who may attend Times Talks, Arts &amp; Leisure Weekend and other New York Times Special Events and Promotions from sign-in and registration lists. Unless we indicate otherwise at the time we collect the information, we will use such information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><a id="mobile" name="mobile"></a><strong>Mobile Messaging Service</strong></p>
<p>The New York Times uses the information collected from your interaction with The New York Times by Text Messaging Service (SMS) ("SMS Service") solely for the purposes of improving the SMS Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed to Third Parties, except as required by law, nor will we use your phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent. Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage, and their practices are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
<p>The New York Times collects the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and The New York Times. When you send a text message to The New York Times or via The New York Times, we log the incoming phone number, the wireless provider associated with the number, and the date and time of the transaction. The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our Mobile Services. The New York Times uses this data to analyze the message traffic in order to operate, develop and improve our SMS Service.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="h" name="h"></a>IS MY INFORMATION PROTECTED?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Data Security: </strong>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place commercially reasonable physical, technical and administrative controls to protect the information. Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><a id="i" name="i"></a>OTHER INFORMATION:</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Compliance With Legal Process<br /></strong></p>
<p>We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the NYT Services; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).</p>
<p><strong><a id="KidsPrivacy" name="KidsPrivacy"></a>Children's Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>COPPA Compliance:</strong> Except for The Learning Network (see below), The New York Times does not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 13.</p>
<p><strong>The Learning Network:</strong> The Learning Network is a free service for parents, teachers and students, and does not require registration. The Student Connections section is specifically directed at students, grades 6 to 12. Within this section, the Ask a Reporter page and the Student Letters page allow students to either send a question to a Times reporter or submit a letter to the editor, providing their first name, grade, state/country and, optionally, their e-mail address. The information requested on these pages is used solely for participation in these activities, and is not shared or sold to third parties. If an e-mail address is provided, it will only be used for a one-time response back to the child. After responding to the child, the e-mail address is deleted. Access to the above services is not conditioned on more information than is reasonably necessary to provide the services. Because we're concerned about a parent's right to consent to the collection and use of their child's personal information, when a question or letter is published, only the student's first name, grade and state/country appear on the site. To request removal of this information (non-personally identifiable) or to review or remove the optional e-mail address (personal information collected), please use <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/feedback/index.html">this form</a> to contact the Learning Network.</p>
<p>These children's guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technology evolves rapidly and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. In the unlikely event of such changes they will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practice with respect to the use of children's personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and will not affect children's personal information previously collected.</p>
<p>For any questions concerning The Learning Network, please contact Katherine Schulten, NYTimes.com, 620 Eighth Avenue, 9th floor, New York, NY 10018. Telephone: (212) 556-8391.</p>
<p><strong><a id="caliPrivacy" name="caliPrivacy"></a>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>Under the California “Shine The Light” law, California residents may opt-out of the NYT’s disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, you may choose to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by submitting a request in writing to Customer Care, P.O. Box 8041, Davenport, IA 52808-8041 or by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:opt-out@nytimes.com?subject=Opt-out">opt-out@nytimes.com</a>. It is important to note that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures made for non-marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong><a id="j" name="j"></a>Changes to This Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on this page. If we make a significant or material change in the way we use your personal information, the change will be posted on this page thirty (30) days prior to taking effect and registered users will be notified via e-mail.</p>
