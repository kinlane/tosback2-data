		<p>This privacy policy (the “<u>Privacy Policy</u>”) describes the information about you that A+E collects through the Websites and how this information is used, maintained and, in some cases, shared. A+E values your use of the Websites and is committed to protecting your privacy.&nbsp; A+E shares your information only as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; A+E has provided this Privacy Policy to assist you in understanding the information that we collect, how we use it and the ways we maintain it, including the security of your personal information. By visiting or using the Websites, services, applications and any other pages, features or content on the Websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to A+E while visiting the Websites, and does not apply to any information that A+E has received, obtained or may obtain offline or through other traditional means.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
    <li><p class="common-legal-header"><a name="general-information-collected">GENERAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</a></p>
		<p>In order to enhance the content contained on the Websites, A+E may gather and store certain information about your visit.&nbsp; “General Information” is information about you or your activities through which you cannot be identified.&nbsp; This information may include some or all of the following items:</p>
			<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
				<li>The Internet Protocol (“<u>IP</u>”) address of your Internet Service Provider (“<u>ISP</u>”) and/or your computer, if it has its own static IP address.&nbsp; The domain name may also be collected. Your IP location information may be used during your visit to the Websites to serve you advertisements for goods or services available in your specific location, however, such information will not be collected or maintained by A+E except in aggregate form.</li>
				<li>The date, time, length of stay and specific A+E web pages, images, documents or forms accessed by you at such Website.</li>
				<li>Whether you are viewing any of the Websites for the first time, or are a return visitor.</li>
				<li>The Uniform Resource Locator (“<u>URL</u>”) of the website or advertisement that referred you to any of the Websites.</li>
				<li>The search engine that referred you and any search strings or phrases entered into the search engine to find any of the Websites.</li>
				<li>Demographic information concerning your country of origin and language(s) used.</li>
				<li>The type and version of the Internet browser used to visit any of the Websites, the operating system on your computer and information regarding errors when viewing any of the Websites.</li>
			</ol>
		<p>A+E collects this General Information and may use it to generate aggregate statistics about visitors to the Websites.&nbsp; In situations where it is possible to do so, General Information may be linked to Personal Information.<br>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	
    <li><p class="common-legal-header"><a name="personal-information-collected">PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</a></p>
		<p>“Personal Information” is information through which you can be identified.&nbsp; Providing your personal information to A+E is your choice.&nbsp; A+E maintains one or more databases to store your Personal Information and may keep such information indefinitely. Personal Information that A+E may collect from you includes, but is not limited to, your name, postal address(es), telephone number(s), facsimile number(s), email address(es), date of birth and any other information that you voluntarily provide.&nbsp; Personal Information you volunteer is used by A+E for internal verification, to complete requested transactions, to ensure appropriate legal use of A+E’s goods and/or services, to provide you notification about updates to the Websites, goods, services and data and to help provide you with technical support for A+E’s goods and services.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Your Personal Information is collected from our Websites, through email and/or through online applications you complete, forums and message boards, blogs, requests for newsletters, requests for channel or show information, playing our games or in our virtual worlds, entering sweepstakes and prize promotions, taking surveys, reporting problems and through any of your other activities with A+E.&nbsp; The Personal Information that A+E collects depends on the nature of your activities.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>For example:</p>
			<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
				<li><u>Registration</u> – in order to register and activate an account for any of our Websites, you will need to provide Personal Information such as your user name, email address, date of birth, nationality and postal/zip code. We strongly encourage you not to use any Personal Information in your username or password.</li>
				<li><u>Sweepstakes and other prize promotions</u> – from time to time, A+E may present sweepstakes, contests, special offers or other promotions, and in order for you to enter and win such promotions, you may need to provide Personal Information. The type and amount of Personal Information required will depend on the promotion. For example, a vacation sweepstakes entry will require you to provide, at a minimum, your full name, address, telephone number, date of birth and email address.&nbsp; In the event that you are a sweepstakes or prize promotion winner, we will require you to submit to us a W9, which will require you to provide additional information, such as your social security number, in order to receive the prize.</li>
				<li><u>Voluntary submissions</u> – information that you voluntarily submit on our “Contact Us” web page and via other surveys and feedback will require the disclosure of your first name and email address, may also include your telephone number and is used by A+E to enhance our Websites or to reply to your questions or comments.</li>
				<li><u>Online purchases</u> – when you place an order online, we collect information associated with the transaction, including your full name, billing and mailing addresses, credit card, banking or other payment information, products ordered, shipping information and identity verification information (driver’s license, social security number). This information is used to enhance the goods that we offer through our store, as well as to ensure that our financial partners can process the payment to us and that our third party fulfillment company can deliver the products that you ordered to the address that you provided.</li>
				<li><u>Invitations</u> – if you invite someone to use a feature of one of our Websites, we will disclose your real name as part of the invitation you send, as this information is necessary to ensure that the invited person knows who has sent the invitation.</li>
				<li><u>Mobile</u>– A+E collects information regarding your GPS location when you use the Websites and associated services from your mobile device if your device has location services enabled.</li>
			</ol>
	</li>
	
    <li><p class="common-legal-header"><a name="personal-information-use">PERSONAL INFORMATION USE</a></p>
		<p>Unless otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy or unless legally required to do so, A+E will not sell, rent or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to any outside company or organization.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy excludes data that may be stored or transmitted to or from the service provider hosting the Websites.</p>
		<p>In addition to those uses set forth in Section 3 above, A+E may hire companies to help provide products or services, like a shipping company that may deliver packages, a financial partner that assists in the completion of transactions you request or any other third party that is needed to assist in the completion of transactions you request.&nbsp; In those instances, there is a need to share your information with these third parties.&nbsp; A+E may also work with other companies who help either to gather your information or to communicate with you.&nbsp; Your opt-out of receiving information from us and/or third parties will not apply to sharing by A+E of your Personal Information with any of these third parties.&nbsp; Nonetheless, except as separately permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy, these third parties are allowed to gather, receive and use your information only for the purposes described herein or as required by law.</p>
		<p>A+E may make bulletin boards, chat rooms, job listing areas, message boards, news groups and other community services available to you on the Websites.&nbsp; Please understand that any information that is disclosed by you in these areas becomes public information.&nbsp; When you disclose such information in a bulletin board, message board, chat room, blog or any other public forum, you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; A+E has no control over its use and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information or any other information about yourself.&nbsp; The information presented in these areas reflects the views of the individual users or hosts and does not necessarily reflect the views of A+E or any of its affiliates.&nbsp; A+E reserves the right (but has no obligation) to monitor the use of bulletin boards, message boards, chat rooms, blogs or other public forums on the Websites.</p>
		<p>A+E may also disclose your Personal Information if: (a) your information is subject to disclosure in response to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants or orders served on A+E; (b) your information is subject to disclosure to protect A+E’s rights or property, to enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy and/or A+E’s Terms of Use and/or to prevent harm to yourself or to another; or (c) your information is subject to disclosure or transfer if A+E or its business is sold or offered for sale to another entity or individual(s), a petition for relief is filed under U.S. Bankruptcy laws for or against A+E or if A+E becomes subject to an order of appointment of a trustee or receiver.&nbsp; A+E reserves the right to release and/or use all information contained within our databases, access logs or other records concerning you if you violate this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or other rules, policies, notices, agreements or guidelines, or if you intentionally or unintentionally partake (or are reasonably suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity, including but not limited to hacking, even without a subpoena, warrant or other court order, and to release such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests and as otherwise required by law and/or to initiate our own legal proceedings.&nbsp; A+E cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using the Websites (or any part thereof) for illegal activities.&nbsp; A+E also reserves the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement individuals or to entities for investigation or prosecution.</p>
		<p>A+E may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your Personal Information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.&nbsp; In the event that we purchase a business, the Personal Information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.&nbsp; In the event that we sell a business, we will attempt to include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your Personal Information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Thus, any of your opt-out requests will not affect our right to transfer your information to a purchaser in these circumstances.&nbsp; A+E also reserves the right to transfer your Personal Information to a third party in the event of a transfer of all or substantially all of A+E’s assets to a third party, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A+E may take your Personal Information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information).&nbsp; Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the right of A+E to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and A+E may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any manner in A+E’s sole discretion.<br>&nbsp;</p>

The information that Cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit and your registration information.&nbsp; Cookies offer you many conveniences for our Websites.&nbsp; For example, they allow A+E to recognize certain information, such as your browser type, so we know if you can view certain plug-ins like Macromedia Flash files.&nbsp; They also allow us to streamline your visit to the Websites based on your previous visits.</p>
		<p>Cookies may be either permanent or temporary.&nbsp; A+E uses both temporary and permanent cookies.&nbsp; A temporary or “session” Cookie is placed on your computer during your visit to any of our Websites and is deleted when you exit your Internet browser and/or turn off your computer. A permanent or “persistent” Cookie means that the Cookie stays on your hard drive until you delete it. You can delete our permanent Cookie at any time by following the instructions contained in your browser’s help file, or by contacting the company providing your browser’s technical support.&nbsp; A+E does not use cookies to store information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers or any other highly sensitive Personal Information.</p>
		<p>You may configure your browser to accept or deny Cookies from our Websites.&nbsp; However, disabling or denying Cookies from our Websites may render parts of them inaccessible or may cause certain web pages not to properly load. There are also several services and websites which allow you to visit websites, including our Websites anonymously. Again, you may not be able to access or use all of the web pages for the Websites if you use these anonymizing services or websites.<br>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>A+E may use “Web Beacons,” sometimes referred to as “clear gifs” or “web bugs,” which is another way (instead of Cookies) to help personalize your experience on the Websites.&nbsp; Web Beacons are typically invisible to you and are generally embedded in very small clear graphics files. We may use Web Beacons to monitor certain non-personally identifiable information about you, including the URL of the page from which the Web Beacon originated, the type of browser used, the IP address of your computer and the time you viewed the Web Beacon. We may also use Web Beacons to assist our third party advertising and/or content companies in providing the contact they believe you want to see. Web Beacons are also used to allow such third parties to determine how many people view the advertisements and/or click through, and to assist in serving and managing advertisements and content.&nbsp; While Web Beacons do not collect Personal Information, the information collected by them may be used in conjunction with Cookies to identify aggregate information about our Website users.</p>
