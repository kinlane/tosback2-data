EMG's Safe Harbor certification can be found at <a href="http://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx">http://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx</a>.

        <li>EMG recognizes the European Union's comprehensive privacy and data protection legislation, the Directive on Data Protection 95/46/EC ("the Directive") which applies to the EEA. EMG also recognizes Switzerland's ("CH") Federal Act on Data Protection ("FADP"). Together, these data protection regimes ("EEA/CH") restrict companies and other organizations from transferring personal data from the EEA/CH to countries that do not meet mandated "adequacy standards" for when it is received in third party countries, such as the United States. Based on the commitments and assertions of the Policy, EMG hereby asserts compliance with the Principles of the Safe Harbor.</li>
