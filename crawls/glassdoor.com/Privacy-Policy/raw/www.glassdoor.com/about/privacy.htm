		<h1>Glassdoor Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated in January 2012.</p>

		<p>
			Glassdoor, Inc. (&ldquo;<strong>Glassdoor</strong>&rdquo;,
			&ldquo;<strong>we</strong>&rdquo;, or &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>&rdquo;) takes the
			privacy and protection of personal information very seriously. By visiting the Site,
			registering as a Member, or using the Services, you acknowledge and accept the
			practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy
			(&ldquo;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&rdquo;). Unless otherwise defined herein,
			capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the
			Glassdoor Terms of Use, which can be found at
			<a href='http://www.glassdoor.com/about/terms.htm' data-transition='slide'>http://www.glassdoor.com/about/terms.htm</a>
			and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.  This Privacy Policy describes
			Glassdoor's practices with respect to Personal Information that we collect when you
			use the Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;<strong>Personal Information</strong>&rdquo; is information that is personally
			identifiable like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other
			non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.  We collect and use Personal
			Information as described in this Privacy Policy from the Users of our Services.
		</p>
		<p class='strong allCaps'>
			BY USING THE SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY
			CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
		</p>

		<p class='strong allCaps'>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.</p>

		<h2><strong>Information We Collect</strong></h2>

		<p>We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Our Member registration process to create an Account requires you to provide us
				with your e-mail address and password of your choice. Furthermore, you have to
				provide either an employer review or salary report to become a Member.
			</li>
			<li>
				When you use our Facebook App or connect to our Site using you Facebook Account,
				you will be asked to share information as more specifically described about
				Facebook below.
			</li>
			<li>
				When you choose to contribute content or participate in our surveys (either
				directly, or through third party service providers), or provide any other
				information to the Services through other means, we will collect all the
				information you provide.
			</li>
			<li>
				In connection with employer and interview reviews, salary reports, surveys, and
				other content you may contribute, Glassdoor (and/or its third party service
				providers) will collect a wide variety of employee- and salary-related information
				on an optional basis. Please be aware that while some pieces of information that
				you provide to us would not be sufficient to identify you when seen by another
				User without any context, the combination of different pieces of information that
				you have provided for viewing by other Users, or any contextual information, may
				allow other Users to identify you.
			</li>
			<li>
				When you contact us by sending us an e-mail or when you use any of our contact
				forms, we will collect any information that is contained in (and/or attached to)
				your e-mail, text message, or that you enter into such forms.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><strong>Personal Information from Facebook</strong></h2>
		<p>
			The following section sets forth the data collection and usage policies and practices
			that apply to when you use our Facebook Application  or when you join or sign in
			(&ldquo;<strong>Connect</strong>&rdquo;) to Glassdoor using your Facebook Account (collectively all
			called &ldquo;<strong>the App</strong>&rdquo;). Unless specifically described in this section, the
			remainder of this Privacy Policy otherwise applies.
		</p>
		<p>
			NOTE: Your use of Facebook in general and your relationship with Facebook are subject
			to Facebook's own Data Use Policy, Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, Platform
			Principles and their other published policies and principles. We do not control and
			are not responsible for Facebook's processing of your information. We strongly
			recommend that you carefully review and familiarize yourself with all Facebook's
			statements, policies and principles before you start using our App.
		</p>

		<h3>About the App and the Information Collected</h3>

		<p>
			Our Facebook App helps you establish a professional network on Glassdoor based on your
			existing network of Facebook connections. When you use the App or Connect to Glassdoor
			using your Facebook Account, you authorize us to collect, cache, and use the
			information that you agreed Facebook could provide to us. We use some of your Facebook
			information to establish your Profile on Glassdoor and to enhance our services to you.
			Your Facebook privacy and application settings may affect the information that you
			give us. You can find out more about controlling these settings on Facebook.
		</p>

		<h3>Collecting Information through the App</h3>
		<p>
			When you use our App you share some of your Facebook information with us and other
			members of our Community. When you first start using the App or Connect using
			Facebook, you are asked to share some information. Depending on your applicable
			Facebook settings, we will access, cache and use that information for the App and your
			benefit.  Currently, you are asked to share the following information
			(&ldquo;<strong>Facebook Information</strong>&rdquo;):
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>General Information</strong> &ndash; name, profile picture, gender,
				connections and any other content that is publicly available to everyone.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Profile Information</strong> &ndash; current city, education history and
				work history.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Information Shared with You</strong> &ndash; current cities, education
				histories and work histories.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Contact Information</strong> &ndash; email.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If your friend connects with the App, the App uses your name, profile picture, gender,
			user ID, connections, and any other content that is Profile available to everyone.
			The App also uses professional information about you that your friend can access like
			your current city, education history, and work history.  If you are using the App or
			have an account with Glassdoor, the App may be able to connect you with your friend.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are also asked to allow the App to send you emails, to post status messages,
			notes, photos, and videos to Facebook on your behalf.  Facebook may also share your
			location and your age, if available, for our security measures and to control
			age-appropriate content. You may also give us information with your requests for App
			support, your feedback or other communications you direct to us.  Any such information
			will be treated in the same manner as Facebook Information.
		</p>

		<h3>Register or Sign On with Facebook</h3>
		<p>
			You may Connect to Glassdoor using Facebook to open or access your Glassdoor account.
			We may use your Facebook information to link the App to your existing Glassdoor
			account, if you have one. Your information is used to maintain your account, to
			associate your Profile, to provide you access to restricted content and to communicate
			with you. You may delink your Glassdoor account from your Facebook account by logging
			into your Glassdoor account and changing your account settings from within My Account.
		</p>

		<h3>How we use Facebook Information</h3>
		<p>
			We use your Facebook Information in the following ways:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				To provide benefits to you and others, like helping you, your friends and
				potential employers and business opportunities connect and share professional
				information and potential interest in career opportunities.
			</li>
			<li>
				To provide Glassdoor services, the App, and their respective features,
				functionality and related services.
			</li>
			<li>
				To personalize and target content, services, career opportunities and advertising,
				including location-based content, services, opportunities and advertising.
			</li>
			<li>
				To build, maintain and share your Profile.
			</li>
			<li>
				To manage user accounts, communications and for internal processes and reporting.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Professional Profile</h3>
		<p>
			Your Professional Profile (&ldquo;<strong>Profile</strong>&rdquo;) is your business card and
			professional resume for use with the App. You may use you Facebook Information to
			complete a Profile that is shared with other App users and Community members. You may
			access, update, change or remove your Profile information at any time by logging into
			your account and following the instructions to Edit Profile.
		</p>

		<h3>Communications through the App</h3>
		<p>
			We may contact you through email, the App, Facebook and other similar channels to
			provide notifications, announcements, respond to customer support inquiries, and to
			present you with professional opportunities on our behalf and on behalf of our
			partners. We may contact you with informational and service-related communications,
			for security updates and quality control, for your feedback and to respond to you.
			We may also send you promotional communications on our behalf and on behalf of our
			partners. You can opt out of receiving promotional communications email messages by
			clicking "unsubscribe" in the message or changing your email settings in My Account.
		</p>

		<h3>Access and Control of Information from Facebook</h3>
		<p>
			To manage the information we receive from Facebook, follow the instructions on
			Facebook for updating your information and your Facebook Application Settings and
			Privacy Settings. Once we receive your information from Facebook, that information
			will be cached and used by us in accordance with this Statement. Facebook Privacy
			Settings let you choose the information that is Profile available to everyone and can
			limit some of the information you and your friends can make available to the App. You
			may block all Facebook Platform applications, including the App, from accessing any
			of your Facebook information using your Application Settings.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your Profile and Facebook Information may be publicly available to anyone using the
			App, including your Connections and other members of the Community. You may access,

			associate this information with Personal Information that we have collected from you.
