  		 <strong><i>1.2 Information We Collect Automatically</i></strong><br /><br />
  		 
  		 Like many companies, we use "cookies" or other similar technology (including flash cookies, e-tags, cache browsers and GIFs etc.) on the Website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Website before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify Website features in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience, for example, by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, while you are visiting a particular page on this site.  <br /><br />

By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor this site to our visitors. We may also enter into arrangements with outside companies that possess technology that allows us to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on this Website. To learn more about those companies and how you can opt-out of targeted advertising on this site, please click on "AdChoices" at the <a href="index.html#ad-choices">bottom of each page</a>.

Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will likely be less relevant to you and your interests. <br /><br />

We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and/or connection information. During some visits we may use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information.  <br /><br />

  		 We may also use anonymous data in aggregate form for purposes of research or analysis. In order to better understand and serve our customers, we may conduct research based on customer demographics, interests and behaviors. Although this aggregated data may be based in part on personal information it does not identify any users personally. We may share this type of anonymous data with third parties, including our affiliates, agents, service providers and current and prospective business partners to administer the Website and for advertising, promotional and other business purposes.  <br /><br />
