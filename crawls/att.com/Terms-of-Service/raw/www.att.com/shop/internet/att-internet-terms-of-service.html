<p><b>IMPORTANT: THIS AGREEMENT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</b><b>&nbsp;</b><b> PARAGRAPH 13 REQUIRES ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. PARAGRAPH 19 LIMITS AT&amp;T'S LIABILITY. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.</b></p> 
<p>This Agreement is based on four general principles.&nbsp; First, AT&amp;T supports our customers’ right to free expression.&nbsp; Second, AT&amp;T will give our customers clear notice of any meaningful limitations on the Services.&nbsp; Third, AT&amp;T will give our customers clear information about the experience they can expect when using the Services.&nbsp; Fourth, AT&amp;T will provide high speed Internet access service in discrete, non-overlapping speed tiers.</p> 
<p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Changes to this Agreement</b></p> 
<p>From time to time, we may change this Agreement. We will provide you with thirty (30) calendar days notice of material changes via either your Member Account e-mail address or any other email address you provide, posting online at <a href="http://www.att.com/internet-terms" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2013053">http://www.att.com/internet-terms</a>, recorded announcement, bill message, bill insert, newspaper ad, postcard, letter, or call to your billed telephone number or U.S. mail. It is your responsibility to check for any such notices. Your continued subscription to the Service after the effective date of the change constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</p> 
<p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Service</b></p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">a. <b><i>Speed</i></b><i>. </i>The Service is composed of narrowband or broadband access to the Internet provided by AT&amp;T. The Site, provided by AT&amp;T and Yahoo!, is composed of a broad selection of on-line resources including email, communication tools, forums, shopping services, search services and personalized content and branded programming.&nbsp; AT&amp;T offers many broadband service options, each of which has a unique Service Capability Speed range.&nbsp; The current speed ranges may be found at <a href="http://att.com/speedtiers" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2013053">http://att.com/speedtiers</a>.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a name="OLE_LINK1" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2013053"></a>The speeds identified at <a href="http://att.com/speedtiers" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2013053">http://att.com/speedtiers</a> are Service Capability Speeds, which are the downstream rates at which your line transfers Internet access data between the network interface device at your home, office or apartment building to the first piece of routing equipment in AT&amp;T’s network. &nbsp;Service Capability Speeds should not be confused with Throughput Speed, which is the speed at which your modem receives and sends Internet access data (“Throughput Speed”). These speeds may vary and are not guaranteed. Throughput speed depends upon many factors including customer location, destination and traffic on the Internet,&nbsp; interference with high frequency spectrum on&nbsp; your telephone line, wiring inside your home, office or apartment, the capacity or performance of your computer or modem, the server with which you are communicating, internal network factors, and the networks you and others are using when communicating. In order to provide a consistently high-quality video service, AT&amp;T Uverse High Speed Internet throughput speeds may be temporarily reduced when a customer is using other U-verse services in a manner that requires high bandwidth. This could occur more often with higher speed Internet access products.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">AT&amp;T may periodically introduce new speed ranges or revise the existing speed ranges. Because these new speed ranges may become&nbsp;available before this Agreement is updated, you should check www.att.com for the most current product information. For purposes of clarity, this Agreement applies to all speed ranges offered by AT&amp;T, even those which are not specifically identified above.&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">b.<b> </b><b><i>IP Addresses</i></b>. AT&amp;T High Speed Internet and AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet Services are provided with either a dynamic Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, a static IP address, or multiple static IP address service (as applicable) at AT&amp;T’s sole discretion.&nbsp; Static IP addresses are not available with all speeds. The dynamic IP address is a single Internet address intended for use with a single Member Account and any associated Sub Accounts.&nbsp; The static IP address or multiple static IP address is intended for use with a single computer or a network of computer/servers.&nbsp; You may not use the Service in a manner that is inconsistent with these intended uses.&nbsp; AT&amp;T High Speed Internet services will support both IPV6 and IPV4 Internet addresses; however, to reach IPv6-exclusive Internet content, some of your equipment may require upgrades or replacement.&nbsp; AT&amp;T Dial service will support web sites that utilize IPV4, but it will not support IPV6-only web sites. For more information about IPv6 and how it affects you, visit att.com/ipv6.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">c<i>. </i><b><i>Availability. </i></b>The Service is not available in all areas, and may not be available at certain speeds (or at all) at your location, even if our initial testing indicated that your line qualified for a particular speed or Service.&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">d.<b><i> </i></b><b><i>Service/Site Changes. </i></b>AT&amp;T reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service or Site (including rates and charges), temporarily or permanently. If AT&amp;T makes a change that would have a material impact on your Service, AT&amp;T will give you at least thirty (30) calendar days notice. The terms and conditions for temporary changes, if any, will be included in the notice and incorporated by reference into this Agreement at: <a href="http://www.att.com/temporaryterms" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2013053">www.att.com/temporaryterms</a>. Your continued subscription to the Service after the effective date of the change constitutes your acceptance of the changes and the associated terms and conditions. In lieu of notice and website posting, AT&amp;T may instead, at its sole discretion, require customers to enter into an agreement with AT&amp;T regarding temporary material changes.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">e.<b><i> </i></b><b><i>Conversion from DSL to U-verse High Speed Internet</i></b>. When AT&amp;T is able to provision U-verse High Speed Internet at your location, we may, in our discretion, discontinue your DSL service and make available to you AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet at the then applicable rates, terms and conditions, which may differ from your previous DSL Service rates, terms and conditions (including bundle discounts). If you are on a term plan and your price will increase as a result of this conversion, you will not have to pay any applicable ETF if you elect to cancel service.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Your new AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet will require different customer premises equipment (“CPE”).&nbsp; When you are selected for conversion, we will provide at least thirty days notice of the discontinuation of your service via e-mail. Thirty days after such notice, we may at our sole discretion, either disconnect your service or temporarily suspend your service for up to fifteen days before we permanently discontinue service.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">f. <b><i>Data Usage</i></b>.

<p><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Registration and Membership</b></p> 
<p>When you complete the registration process for the Site or the Service, you become the “Member Account” holder. You must be 18 years or older to be a Member Account holder. You will be asked to choose a unique “Member ID” for your account. Customers of the Service may also create up to ten “Sub Accounts” (each of which will have a separate password and Member ID). Each Sub Account will also be required to accept this Agreement and complete the Sub Account registration. The Member Account holder is responsible for all activity associated with the Member Account and any of its Sub Accounts, including all fees and charges, whether the charges are incurred by the Member Account or the Sub Accounts. If you have, or later obtain, an AT&amp;T Access ID, you are subject to the <b>AT&amp;T Access ID Terms and Conditions</b> (available at <a href="http://www.att.com/accessidterms" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2013053">www.att.com/accessidterms</a>), which are incorporated herein by reference.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All information that you provide to AT&amp;T and Yahoo! must be accurate, including your name, address, credit or charge card numbers and expiration dates, and any payment information (“Registration Data”).&nbsp; You are responsible for keeping such information up-to-date and must provide changes promptly to the AT&amp;T Yahoo! Member Center by going to <a href="http://att.yahoo.com/myaccount" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2013053">http://att.yahoo.com/myaccount</a>.</p> 
<p><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Pricing</b><b></b></p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">a. <b><i>Term Plans, Bundle Discounts.</i></b> When you purchased the Service, you agreed to specific price and plan, which may have included a term of one, two, or three years (“Term Plan”). Similarly, some plans may offer a discount on the Service if you sign up for other AT&amp;T services (“Bundle Discount”). You agree to maintain your Service and the bundled services for the applicable term.&nbsp; If you signed up for a Term Plan or a Bundle Discount, the price available with those plans is valid until one of the following occurs, at which time your price may revert to the then-existing price for your service: (1) the term expires; (2) you move from your current service address to another service address; or (3) you drop one of the AT&amp;T services you were required to purchase to receive the special rate.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">b. <b><i>Dial-up Access Options and Toll Charges.</i></b><i> </i>AT&amp;T will provide telephone numbers to connect to or register for the Service. Depending on location, local access numbers for dial-up Internet access may not be available in your area. Even access numbers in your area code may result in toll, usage, or long distance charges. Please check with your local phone company to determine whether additional charges apply. You are responsible for selecting the best number for you and for all telephone fees and charges associated with the use of the telephone number you select. In no event will AT&amp;T or Yahoo! be responsible for any telephone fees or charges incurred as a result of the telephone number you select. Use of the Service (or portions thereof) and of specific telephone numbers is subject to change or interruption at the telecommunication company's or at AT&amp;T’s discretion.</p> 
<p><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Termination or Cancellation of Service</b></p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">a.<b>&nbsp;</b><i> </i><b><i>Cancellation of Service by Customer.</i></b><i> </i>When you purchased the Service, you agreed to a specific price and plan, which may have included a term. <b>You agree that if you cancel your plan before the end of the term, you will pay the early termination fee </b>associated with that plan.&nbsp; At the conclusion of your term or if you did not sign up for a term plan, the term for your Service will be month-to-month.&nbsp; When you cancel your service, your account ID e-mail address will remain active, as will all e-mail subaccounts you have created. The e-mail accounts may be accessed from the att.net website.&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">b.<b><i> </i></b><b><i>Suspension/Termination by AT&amp;T or Yahoo!</i></b><i>. </i>AT&amp;T respects freedom of expression and believes it is a foundation of our free society to express differing points of view. AT&amp;T will not terminate, disconnect or suspend service because of the views you or we express on public policy matters, political issues or political campaigns<b>.</b> AT&amp;T and/or Yahoo! may, however, immediately terminate or suspend your Member Account and Sub Accounts, and all or a portion of your Service without notice if: (a) your payment is more than 30 days overdue; (b) you provide false or inaccurate information to AT&amp;T; (c) you (or a Sub Account associated with your Member ID) violate this Agreement or the AT&amp;T Acceptable Use Policy;&nbsp; (d) you (or a Sub Account associated with your Member ID) engage in conduct that is a violation of any law, regulation or tariff (including, without limitation, copyright and intellectual property laws); or (e) if you engage in conduct that is threatening, abusive or harassing to&nbsp; AT&amp;T or Yahoo employees, including, for example, making threats to physically harm or damage&nbsp; employee or company property; frequent use of profane or vulgar language; or repeatedly contacting our customer service representatives for reasons that do not pertain to our provisioning, maintenance, repair or general servicing of your high speed Internet access service after you have been asked to stop such conduct.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;If we terminate or suspend your Service, your license to use any software provided in connection with the Service is also terminated or suspended (as applicable). If your Service is terminated, AT&amp;T has the right to immediately delete all data, files, and other information stored in or for your account without further notice to you. You must pay all charges for the Service through the date of termination. Should you wish to resume Service after any suspension, a restoral of service fee may apply.&nbsp; This fee is in addition to all past due charges and other fees.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">c.<b> </b><b><i>Termination of Voice Service</i></b>. If you change or terminate your AT&amp;T local wireline voice service, we may in our discretion either terminate your AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Service or continue to provide it at the then-current rates, terms and conditions applicable for AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Direct, our broadband service without voice. You agree to pay any new or higher monthly fees that may apply to your new Service after termination of the wireline voice service. If AT&amp;T elects to terminate your Service, we reserve the right to charge any applicable early termination fees. For AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet customers, AT&amp;T will continue to provide Internet service after termination of the wireline voice service, unless it is not technically feasible to do so.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">d.<b> </b><b><i>Termination of Dial Service</i></b><b>. </b>&nbsp;Monthly recurring charges for Dial service are not prorated. If you disconnect, cancel, move to another price plan or are suspended by AT&amp;T prior to month end, you will be charged for the entire month of service. If you upgrade your AT&amp;T Dial service to an AT&amp;T High Speed Internet service your Dial charges will be prorated.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">e.<b><i> </i></b><b><i>Access to Yahoo!, After Termination by AT&amp;T</i></b><i>.</i>&nbsp; If your Service is terminated by AT&amp;T, you will no longer have access to your Member account information using your Member ID, except as outlined in this Section and Section 9 (Yahoo! Premium Services). If you combined your Yahoo! ID with a Member ID, you will not be able to access Yahoo! using your combined ID after termination, unless you close your Member ID (your Member ID will be closed automatically no fewer than 60 days after termination). If you did not combine a Yahoo! ID with your Member ID, you will be given the option (when you sign in at Yahoo! using your Member ID) for at least 60 days after termination, to close your Member ID and transfer certain account information to a new Yahoo! ID.&nbsp; If you continue to access a Yahoo! account through a different Internet access provider after your Service account is terminated, then your use of your Yahoo! account after that time will be subject to the Yahoo! Terms of Service at <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2013053">http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html</a> .&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Note:</b> Sub-accounts with a combined Yahoo! ID may be able to access the Yahoo! account provisioned under their combined Yahoo! ID when the Member ID of the Member Account holder is closed. After the Member ID of the Member Account holder is closed, Sub-Accounts who do not have a combined Yahoo! ID will not be able to transfer any of their Member account information to a new Yahoo! ID. Therefore, Sub-Account holders who wish to elect to transfer should make the election before the Member ID of the Member Account holder is closed.</p> 
<p><b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment</b></p> 
<p>Service customers agree to pay: (1) the monthly fee specified when you ordered your Service; (2) the charge for all equipment required for your Service; (3) activation fees, connection and/or installation charges, if any; (4) late fees, restoral of service fees and other applicable service charges; and (4) any applicable taxes, recovery fees and surcharges which AT&amp;T pays to municipalities and other governmental entities and may pass on to you.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b><i>Credit Check / Advance Payments &amp; Deposits</i></b>. Service customers give us permission to obtain their credit information from consumer credit reporting agencies at any time. If we determine that you may be a credit risk due to: (1) unsatisfactory credit rating; (2) insufficient credit history; (3) fraudulent or abusive use of any AT&amp;T services within the last five years; or (4) late payments for current or prior bills, we may refuse to provide the Services or we may require an advance payment, a non-refundable payment, and/or deposit. Interest will not be paid on advance payments or deposits unless required by law. We may require special payment terms such as additional advance payments or deposits if we determine that the initial payment was inadequate. We may establish limits and restrict service or features as we deem appropriate. If your account balance goes beyond the limit we set for you, we may immediately interrupt or suspend service until your balance is brought below the limit. Any charges you incur in excess of your limit become immediately due. Upon determination solely by AT&amp;T of satisfactory payment history or as required by law, AT&amp;T may begin refunding of deposits through bill credits, cash payments, or as otherwise determined solely by AT&amp;T.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>&nbsp;<b><i>Billing</i></b>. For customers who choose to self-install the Service, billing will begin when service is provisioned by AT&amp;T, whether or not customer has installed and begun to use the service. For customers who choose to have a technician install the Service, billing will begin when the installation is complete, unless the customer initially selects to self-install, and subsequently asks for a technician installation.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b><i>Method of Payment</i></b>.

<p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by calling our customer service department at 1-800-288-2020.&nbsp; <b>In the unlikely event that AT&amp;</b><b>T’s customer service department</b><b> is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if AT&amp;T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</b><b>&nbsp;</b> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.&nbsp; Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.&nbsp; Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.&nbsp; <b>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</b><b>&nbsp;</b> For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&amp;T will pay all costs of the arbitration.&nbsp; Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees from AT&amp;T to at least the same extent as you would be in court.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&amp;T will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator’s award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys’ fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what AT&amp;T has offered you to settle the dispute.</p> 
<p><u><b><i>Arbitration Agreement</i></b>:</u></p> 
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">a.&nbsp; AT&amp;T and you agree to arbitrate <b>all disputes and claims </b>between you and AT&amp;T. This arbitration agreement does not include claims against Yahoo, or claims against AT&amp;T or Yahoo that are based in whole or in part on the Site.&nbsp; This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p> 
<p>References to “AT&amp;T,” “you,” and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Service or Site under this or prior Agreements between us. &nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. &nbsp;This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.&nbsp; Such agencies, can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. <b>YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND AT&amp;T ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY </b><b>OR</b><b> TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION</b><b>.</b>&nbsp; This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.&nbsp; This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”).&nbsp; The Notice to AT&amp;T should be addressed to: AT&amp;T Services, Inc., 208 S. Akard, Room 3100.04, Dallas, Texas 75202, Attn: Customer Arbitration (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).&nbsp; If AT&amp;T and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or AT&amp;T may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&amp;T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AT&amp;T is entitled.</p> 
<p><b>You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration from here:</b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b> </b><a href="http://www.att.com/residentialarbitration" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2013053">www.att.com/residentialarbitration</a><b>.</b><br> 
</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">c. After AT&amp;T receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000.&nbsp; (The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000, but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, AT&amp;T will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address).&nbsp; The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org/" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2013053">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. &nbsp;(You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at att.com/arbitration-information.)&nbsp; The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide.&nbsp;Unless AT&amp;T and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. &nbsp;Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&amp;T will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.&nbsp; If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.&nbsp; In such case, you agree to reimburse AT&amp;T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.&nbsp; In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">d.&nbsp; If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of AT&amp;T’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&amp;T will:</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay you the greater of the award or $10,000 (“the alternative payment”), whichever is greater; and</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys’ fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (“the attorney premium”).</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If AT&amp;T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits.&nbsp; The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">e. The right to attorneys’ fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right to attorneys’ fees and expenses you may have under applicable law.&nbsp; Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount.&nbsp; However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys’ fees or costs.&nbsp; Although under some laws AT&amp;T may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&amp;T agrees that it will not seek such an award.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">f. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. <b>YOU AND AT&amp;T AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b> Further, unless both you and AT&amp;T agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.&nbsp; If this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">g. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&amp;T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the period of time that you are receiving Services, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.&nbsp; By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</p> 
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Dispute Resolution with Yahoo</b></p> 
<p>You and Yahoo! each agree that this Agreement and the relationship between You and Yahoo! shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions and that any and all claims, causes of action or disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to the services offered or provided by Yahoo!, or the relationship between you and Yahoo!, shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of Santa Clara, California or the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. You and Yahoo! agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California or the Northern District of California, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.</p>
