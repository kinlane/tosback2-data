<h3>AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Terms of Service / att.net Terms of Use</h3> 
<p></p> 
<div class="internetTOSContent"></div> 
<p>This Terms of Service &amp; Terms of Use (&quot;Agreement&quot;) along with the AT&amp;T Acceptable Use Policy and the AT&amp;T and Yahoo privacy policies, set forth your obligations, AT&amp;T's obligations, and the rules you must follow when using the att.net portal and/or e-mail (&quot;Site&quot;) and/or AT&amp;T High Speed Internet, AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Direct, AT&amp;T Dial and AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet, FastAccess DSL and FastAccess Business DSL, Wireless Broadband provided by BellSouth Entertainment, LLC, BellSouth® Dial Internet Service (&quot;Service(s)&quot;).<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<b>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.<br> 
 This</b> is a binding agreement between you (the Member Account holder), and Yahoo! Inc. (&quot;Yahoo!&quot;) and the AT&amp;T entity that provides the Service and/or Site1.<br> 
<br> 
<b>Your registration, payment for or use of the Site and/or Service constitutes your agreement to be bound by the charges, terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including those incorporated by reference as well as those located at: http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/.<br> 
 <br> 
 IMPORTANT: THIS AGREEMENT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. PARAGRAPH 13 REQUIRES ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. PARAGRAPH 19 LIMITS AT&amp;T'S LIABILITY. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY. </b><br> 
<br> 
This Agreement is based on four general principles. First, AT&amp;T supports our customers' right to free expression. Second, AT&amp;T will give our customers clear notice of any meaningful limitations on the Services. Third, AT&amp;T will give our customers clear information about the experience they can expect when using the Services. Fourth, AT&amp;T will provide high speed Internet access service in discrete, non-overlapping speed tiers.<br> 
<br> 
1. <b><u>Changes to this Agreement </u></b><br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, we may change this Agreement. We will provide you with thirty (30) calendar days notice of material changes via either your Member Account e-mail address or U.S. mail. It is your responsibility to check your e-mail address for any such notices. Your continued subscription to the Service after the effective date of the change constitutes your acceptance of such changes.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
2. <b><u>AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Service </u></b><br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. <i><b>Speed</b></i>. The Service is composed of narrowband or broadband access to the Internet provided by AT&amp;T. The Site, provided by AT&amp;T and Yahoo!, is composed of a broad selection of on-line resources including email, communication tools, forums, shopping services, search services and personalized content and branded programming. AT&amp;T offers many broadband service options, each of which has a unique Service Capability Speed range. The current speed ranges may be found at <a href="http://att.com/speedtiers" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2012108">http://att.com/speedtiers</a>.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The speeds identified at <a href="http://att.com/speedtiers" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2012108">http://att.com/speedtiers</a> are Service Capability Speeds, which are the downstream rates at which your line transfers Internet access data between the network interface device at your home, office or apartment building to the first piece of routing equipment in AT&amp;T's network. Service Capability Speeds should not be confused with Throughput Speed, which is the speed at which your modem receives and sends Internet access data (&quot;Throughput Speed&quot;). These speeds may vary and are not guaranteed. Throughput speed depends upon many factors including customer location, destination and traffic on the Internet, interference with high frequency spectrum on your telephone line, wiring inside your home, office or apartment, the capacity or performance of your computer or modem, the server with which you are communicating, internal network factors, and the networks you and others are using when communicating. In order to provide a consistently high-quality video service, AT&amp;T Uverse High Speed Internet throughput speeds may be temporarily reduced when a customer is using other U-verse services in a manner that requires high bandwidth. This could occur more often with higher speed Internet access products.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AT&amp;T may periodically introduce new speed ranges or revise the existing speed ranges. Because these new speed ranges may become available before this Agreement is updated, you should check www.att.com for the most current product information. For purposes of clarity, this Agreement applies to all speed ranges offered by AT&amp;T, even those which are not specifically identified above.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. <i><b>IP Addresses</b></i>. AT&amp;T High Speed Internet and AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet Services are provided with either a dynamic Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address, a static IP address, or multiple static IP address service (as applicable) at AT&amp;T's sole discretion. Static IP addresses are not available with all speeds. The dynamic IP address is a single Internet address intended for use with a single Member Account and any associated subaccounts. The static IP address or multiple static IP address is intended for use with a single computer or a network of computer/servers. You may not use the Service in a manner that is inconsistent with these intended uses.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. <i><b>Availability</b></i>. The Service is not available in all areas, and may not be available at certain speeds (or at all) at your location, even if our initial testing indicated that your line qualified for a particular speed or Service.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; d. <i><b>Service/Site Changes</b></i>. AT&amp;T reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service or Site (including rates and charges), temporarily or permanently. If AT&amp;T makes a change that would have a material impact on your Service, AT&amp;T will give you at least thirty (30) calendar days notice. The terms and conditions for temporary changes, if any, will be included in the notice and incorporated by reference into this Agreement at: <a href="http://www.att.com/temporaryterms" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2012108">www.att.com/temporaryterms</a>. Your continued subscription to the Service after the effective date of the change constitutes your acceptance of the changes and the associated terms and conditions. In lieu of notice and website posting, AT&amp;T may instead, at its sole discretion, require customers to enter into an agreement with AT&amp;T regarding temporary material changes.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; e.<i><b> Conversion from DSL to U-verse High Speed Internet</b></i>. When AT&amp;T is able to provision U-verse High Speed Internet at your location, we may, in our discretion, discontinue your DSL service and make available to you AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet at the then applicable rates, terms and conditions, which may differ from your previous DSL Service rates, terms and conditions (including bundle discounts). If you are on a term plan and your price will increase as a result of this conversion, you will not have to pay any applicable ETF if you elect to cancel service.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your new AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet will require different customer premises equipment (&quot;CPE&quot;). When you are selected for conversion, we will provide at least thirty days notice of the discontinuation of your service via e-mail. Thirty days after such notice, we may at our sole discretion, either disconnect your service or temporarily suspend your service for up to fifteen days before we permanently discontinue service.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; f. <i><b>Data Usage</b></i>. For more information about the use of your High Speed Internet Service, data usage allowances that may apply to your service, how much data you use, and management of your data usage, please refer to <a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/internet/usage.jsp" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2012108">www.att.com/internet-usage</a>.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
3. <b><u>Registration and Membership</u></b><br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; When you complete the registration process for the Site or the Service, you become the &quot;Member Account&quot; holder. You must be 18 years or older to be a Member Account holder. You will be asked to choose a unique &quot;Member ID&quot; for your account. Customers of the Service may also create up to ten &quot;subaccounts&quot; (each of which will have a separate password and Member ID). Each subaccount will also be required to accept this Agreement and complete the subaccount registration. The Member Account holder is responsible for all activity associated with the Member Account and any of its subaccounts, including all fees and charges, whether the charges are incurred by the Member Account or the subaccounts.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; All information that you provide to AT&amp;T and Yahoo! must be accurate, including your name, address, credit or charge card numbers and expiration dates, and any payment information (&quot;Registration Data&quot;). You are responsible for keeping such information up-to-date and must provide changes promptly to the AT&amp;T Yahoo! Member Center by going to <a href="http://att.yahoo.com/myaccount" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2012108">http://att.yahoo.com/myaccount</a>.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
4. <u><b>Pricing</b></u><br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. <i><b>Term Plans, Bundle Discounts</b></i>. When you purchased the Service, you agreed to specific price and plan, which may have included a term of one or two years (&quot;Term Plan&quot;). Similarly, some plans may offer a discount on the Service if you sign up for other AT&amp;T services (&quot;Bundle Discount&quot;). You agree to maintain your Service and the bundled services for the applicable term. If you signed up for a Term Plan or a Bundle Discount, the price available with those plans is valid until one of the following occurs: (1) the term expires; (2) you move from your current service address to another service address; or (3) you drop one of the AT&amp;T services you were required to purchase to receive the special rate.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. <i><b>Dial-up Access Options and Toll Charges</b></i>. AT&amp;T will provide telephone numbers to connect to or register for the Service. Depending on location, local access numbers for dial-up Internet access may not be available in your area. Even access numbers in your area code may result in toll, usage, or long distance charges. Please check with your local phone company to determine whether additional charges apply. You are responsible for selecting the best number for you and for all telephone fees and charges associated with the use of the telephone number you select. In no event will AT&amp;T or Yahoo! be responsible for any telephone fees or charges incurred as a result of the telephone number you select. Use of the Service (or portions thereof) and of specific telephone numbers is subject to change or interruption at the telecommunication company's or at AT&amp;T's discretion.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
5. <b><u>Termination or Cancellation of Service</u></b><br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. <i><b>Cancellation of Service by Customer</b></i>. When you purchased the Service, you agreed to a specific price and plan, which may have included a term. <b>You agree that if you cancel your plan before the end of the term, you will pay the early termination fee</b> associated with that plan. If you did not sign up for a term plan, the term for your Service will be month-to-month. When you cancel your service, your account ID e-mail address will remain active, as will all e-mail subaccounts you have created. The e-mail accounts may be accessed from the att.net website.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. <i><b>Suspension/Termination by AT&amp;T or Yahoo!</b></i>. AT&amp;T respects freedom of expression and believes it is a foundation of our free society to express differing points of view. AT&amp;T will not terminate, disconnect or suspend service because of the views you or we express on public policy matters, political issues or political campaigns. AT&amp;T and/or Yahoo! may, however, immediately terminate or suspend your Member Account and subaccounts, and all or a portion of your Service without notice if: (a) your payment is more than 30 days overdue; (b) you provide false or inaccurate information to AT&amp;T; (c) you (or a subaccount associated with your Member ID) violate this Agreement or the AT&amp;T Acceptable Use Policy; (d) you (or a subaccount associated with your Member ID) engage in conduct that is a violation of any law, regulation or tariff (including, without limitation, copyright and intellectual property laws); or (e) if you engage in conduct that is threatening, abusive or harassing to AT&amp;T or Yahoo employees, including, for example, making threats to physically harm or damage employee or company property; frequent use of profane or vulgar language; or repeatedly contacting our customer service representatives for reasons that do not pertain to our provisioning, maintenance, repair or general servicing of your high speed Internet access service after you have been asked to stop such conduct.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we terminate or suspend your Service, your license to use any software provided in connection with the Service is also terminated or suspended (as applicable). If your Service is terminated, AT&amp;T has the right to immediately delete all data, files, and other information stored in or for your account without further notice to you. You must pay all charges for the Service through the date of termination. Should you wish to resume Service after any suspension, a restoral of service fee may apply. This fee is in addition to all past due charges and other fees.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. <i><b>Termination of Voice Service</b></i>. If you change or terminate your AT&amp;T local wireline voice service, we may in our discretion either terminate your AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Service or continue to provide it at the then-current rates, terms and conditions applicable for AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Direct, our broadband service without voice. You agree to pay any new or higher monthly fees that may apply to your new Service after termination of the wireline voice service. If AT&amp;T elects to terminate your Service, we reserve the right to charge any applicable early termination fees. For AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet customers, AT&amp;T will continue to provide Internet service after termination of the wireline voice service, unless it is not technically feasible to do so.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; d. <b><i>Termination of Dial Service</i></b>. Monthly recurring charges for Dial service are not prorated. If you disconnect, cancel, move to another price plan or are suspended by AT&amp;T prior to month end, you will be charged for the entire month of service. If you upgrade your AT&amp;T Dial service to an AT&amp;T High Speed Internet service your Dial charges will be prorated.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; e. <i><b>Access to Yahoo! After Termination by AT&amp;T</b></i>. If your Service is terminated by AT&amp;T, you will no longer have access to your Member account information using your Member ID, except as outlined in this Section and Section 9 (Yahoo! Premium Services). If you combined your Yahoo! ID with a Member ID, you will not be able to access Yahoo! using your combined ID after termination, unless you close your Member ID (your Member ID will be closed automatically no fewer than 60 days after termination). If you did not combine a Yahoo! ID with your Member ID, you will be given the option (when you sign in at Yahoo! using your Member ID) for at least 60 days after termination, to close your Member ID and transfer certain account information to a new Yahoo! ID. If you continue to access a Yahoo! account through a different Internet access provider after your Service account is terminated, then your use of your Yahoo! account after that time will be subject to the Yahoo! Terms of Service at <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2012108">http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html.</a><br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Note</b>: Sub-accounts with a combined Yahoo! ID may be able to access the Yahoo! account provisioned under their combined Yahoo! ID when the Member ID of the Member Account holder is closed. After the Member ID of the Member Account holder is closed, Sub-Accounts who do not have a combined Yahoo! ID will not be able to transfer any of their Member account information to a new Yahoo! ID. Therefore, Sub-Account holders who wish to elect to transfer should make the election before the Member ID of the Member Account holder is closed.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
6. <u><b>Payment</b></u><br>

<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. <i><b>Credit Check / Advance Payments &amp; Deposits</b></i>. Service customers give us permission to obtain their credit information from consumer credit reporting agencies at any time. If we determine that you may be a credit risk due to: (1) unsatisfactory credit rating; (2) insufficient credit history; (3) fraudulent or abusive use of any AT&amp;T services within the last five years; or (4) late payments for current or prior bills, we may refuse to provide the Services or we may require an advance payment, a non-refundable payment, and/or deposit. Interest will not be paid on advance payments or deposits unless required by law. We may require special payment terms such as additional advance payments or deposits if we determine that the initial payment was inadequate. We may establish limits and restrict service or features as we deem appropriate. If your account balance goes beyond the limit we set for you, we may immediately interrupt or suspend service until your balance is brought below the limit. Any charges you incur in excess of your limit become immediately due. Upon determination solely by AT&amp;T of satisfactory payment history or as required by law, AT&amp;T may begin refunding of deposits through bill credits, cash payments, or as otherwise determined solely by AT&amp;T.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. <i><b>Billing</b></i>. For customers who choose to self-install the Service, billing will begin when service is provisioned by AT&amp;T, whether or not customer has installed and begun to use the service. For customers who choose to have a technician install the Service, billing will begin when the installation is complete, unless the customer initially selects to self-install, and subsequently asks for a technician installation.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. <i><b>Method of Payment</b></i>. Your monthly charges may be billed via a monthly AT&amp;T bill or to a credit card. Credit card billing is not available for AT&amp;T High Speed Internet Direct.

<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; d. <i><b>Credit Card Billing</b></i>. You may be asked to provide us with a credit card number from a card issuer that we accept in order to activate your Service. You hereby authorize AT&amp;T to charge and/or place a hold on your credit card with respect to any unpaid charges for Services or any related equipment. You authorize the issuer of the credit card to pay any amounts described herein without requiring a signed receipt, and you agree that these TOS are to be accepted as authorization to the issuer of the credit card to pay any amounts described herein without requiring a signed receipt, and you agree that these TOS are to be accepted as authorization to the issuer of the credit card to pay all such amounts. You authorize AT&amp;T and/or any other company who bills products or services, or acts as billing agent for AT&amp;T to continue to attempt to charge and/or place holds with respect to all sums described herein, or any portion thereof, to your credit card until such amounts are paid in full. You agree to provide AT&amp;T with updated credit card information upon AT&amp;T's request and any time the information you previously provided is no longer valid. You acknowledge and agree that neither AT&amp;T nor any AT&amp;T affiliated company will have any liability whatsoever for any non-sufficient funds or other charges incurred by you as a result of such attempts to charge, and/or place holds on, your credit card. If you mistakenly provide a debit card number, instead of a credit card number, you authorize all charges described herein to be applied to such debit card unless and until you provide a credit card number. In the event you are enrolled, or later enroll, in an automatic payment or electronic funds transfer plan, you agree that all sums described herein may be charged, at AT&amp;T's option, to the account number provided for such automatic payment or electronic funds transfer plan. When payment is made by credit card or debit card, payment will also be subject to the terms and conditions established by the credit or debit card issuer. If charges cannot be processed through your credit card, or if your bank draft or electronic funds transfer is returned for insufficient funds, we will charge you an additional $15.00. If the state law where you receive the Service requires a different fee, we will charge you that amount.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; e. <i><b>Online Billing for AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet Members</b></i>. You must register online to establish a personal AT&amp;T My U-verse Account and provide a billing email address. You will then be able to view and pay your bill online by logging on to your personal AT&amp;T My U-verse Account (username and password required).<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You understand that you have sole responsibility for the security of your password and you are solely responsible for notifying AT&amp;T if your password is lost or stolen. AT&amp;T is not liable for any claims, costs, damages, or expenses arising from a lost misplaced, or stolen password. If you have forgotten your password or want to change your password for any reason, you may request to reset your password online. It is your responsibility to notify AT&amp;T immediately if your contact information changes.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; f. <i><b>Late Payment &amp; Failure to Pay</b></i>. If you choose to have the charges for your Service added to your telephone bill, and, if AT&amp;T does not receive your payment before the next billing date, you shall pay to AT&amp;T a late payment charge and/or an interest charge of 1.5% (1% in Louisiana), or the highest amount allowed by law, on all charges due and unpaid. Acceptance of late or partial payments (even if marked &quot;Paid in Full&quot;) shall not waive any of AT&amp;T rights to collect the full amount due. Notice of any disputes must be in writing and received by us within 30 days after you received your bill or you will waive any objection. <b>AT&amp;T may suspend or terminate Service if your payment is past due. If AT&amp;T suspends your service for non-payment, you must pay all past due amounts in order to have service restored, and you may also, at AT&amp;T's sole discretion, be required to pay a service restoral fee.</b> In the event you fail to pay AT&amp;T or AT&amp;T is unable to bill charges to your credit card, AT&amp;T may assign unpaid late balances to a collection agency. In the event legal action is required to recover unpaid amounts, you agree to reimburse AT&amp;T for all costs and expenses incurred to recover sums due, including collection agency fees, attorneys' fees and other legal expenses.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
7.<u><b> Equipment &amp; Software</b></u><br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than the equipment and/or software provided to you by AT&amp;T for use with the Service, you must provide all equipment, devices and software necessary to receive the Service. Any equipment or software that was not provided to you by AT&amp;T is not the responsibility of AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T will not provide support, or be responsible for ongoing maintenance of such equipment. Any AT&amp;T-provided modem or gateway will be either a new or a fully inspected and tested refurbished unit. Regardless of whether the equipment used to access your Service (modem, gateway, etc.) is owned by you or AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T reserves the right to manage such equipment for the duration of your Service, and retains exclusive rights to data generated by the equipment. Neither you nor a third party may change, interfere with, or block access to equipment data or settings.<br> 
<br>

You understand that repair or replacement of equipment may delete stored content, reset personal settings or otherwise alter the functionality of your equipment. If you own the equipment or the equipment is damaged due to your intentional acts or negligence as determined by AT&amp;T, you will be responsible for the price of repair or replacement.<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. <i><b>Additional Equipment Information for AT&amp;T U-verse High Speed Internet Customers</b></i>. AT&amp;T will make available to you certain equipment (including a gateway, or Optical Network Terminal (&quot;ONT&quot;), all of which is herein collectively referred to as &quot;U-verse Equipment&quot;), required for your Service. If you do not purchase U-verse Equipment from AT&amp;T, then you agree to rent the U-verse Equipment, as part of your purchase of the Service and/or other U-verse services. Rental/Purchase options depend on the AT&amp;T U-verse services you order and the installation options you choose.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U-verse Equipment requires electrical power from your premises to operate, which you are responsible for providing. If there is a gateway at your premises, depending on the other U-verse services you purchase, AT&amp;T may provide an initial gateway battery backup unit and an initial backup battery. If there is an ONT at your premises, AT&amp;T will install an initial power supply box and provide an initial backup battery for the Optical Network Terminal power supply box. You hereby agree to be solely responsible for determining when backup batteries for any U-verse Equipment require replacement and for replacing and recycling used batteries. You agree to read and follow all manufacturer or vendor directions for the replacement and recycling of backup batteries.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tampering with the U-verse Equipment, or attempting to connect the equipment to other hardware, will be treated as damage due to your intentional acts or negligence. You agree that you will use the equipment only for its intended residential use, and not for any other purpose (such as on another AT&amp;T network, or on another provider's (non-AT&amp;T) network).<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree to notify AT&amp;T immediately, in writing or by calling the AT&amp;T customer support line, if the U-verse Equipment is stolen or if you become aware at any time that Services are being stolen or fraudulently used. When you call or write, you must provide a detailed description of the circumstances of the theft, including documentation of theft or fraudulent use of the U-verse Equipment or Services (such as a copy of a police report). You will be responsible for all charges incurred until you report the theft or fraudulent use. You will also be responsible for stolen U-verse Equipment not owned by you, however, AT&amp;T may in its sole discretion waive or reduce charges upon submission of documentation of theft or other circumstances. Failure to provide notice to AT&amp;T of theft in a timely manner may result in the termination of your Services and additional charges to you. Unless notified otherwise by AT&amp;T, after you report the theft or fraudulent use of the Services, you will remain responsible for paying your monthly fees for Services not stolen or fraudulently used.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return of equipment after termination of Service: if your U-verse service is provided by an iNID (Intelligent Network Interface Device), you must return the TV receivers. You should not return the iNID home networking hub, (Model# j38HG). All other unowned U-verse equipment must be returned to AT&amp;T undamaged, within twenty one (21) calendar days after the Service is terminated. If equipment is not returned within twenty one (21) calendar days, or is returned damaged, you will be charged for the value of the U-verse Equipment. We may retain any advance payment or deposit, or portion thereof that previously had not been refunded, if you fail to return the U-verse Equipment within this time period If all U-verse Equipment is returned within three (3) months of termination, any fees charged for such U-verse Equipment will be refunded (other than fees for damages). No refunds will be made for U-verse Equipment returned after three (3) months from termination.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. <i><b>Use by Children</b></i>. AT&amp;T is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. For this reason, children under the age of 13 will not be permitted to access the Site or Service unless added as a subaccount by a Member Account holder who is their legal guardian. You understand that by adding a child to your Member Account, you are giving your child access to features that are available as part of the Site or Service (including email, message boards, clubs, and instant messages) and the Internet. Please remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a broad audience. It is your responsibility to determine whether the features provided through the Site and Service are appropriate for a minor.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AT&amp;T suggests that you take advantage of the access controls offered with the Service, which allow you, as the Member Account holder, to block access to certain types of web content you may feel are inappropriate for minors.

13. <u><b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION WITH AT&amp;T BY BINDING ARBITRATION</b></u><br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</b><br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling AT&amp;T at 1-800-288-2020. In the unlikely event that AT&amp;T's business office is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if AT&amp;T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. AT&amp;T will pay all costs of arbitration, no matter who wins, so long as your claim is not frivolous. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from AT&amp;T to at least the same extent as you would be in court. In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&amp;T will pay you and your attorney a special premium if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what AT&amp;T has offered you to settle the dispute.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Arbitration Agreement: </i></b><br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. AT&amp;T and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between you and AT&amp;T which are Arbitration Claims. &quot;Arbitration Claims&quot; as used in this Agreement means claims against AT&amp;T based in whole or in part upon the Service(s), and does not include claims against Yahoo, or claims against AT&amp;T or Yahoo that are based in whole or in part on the Site. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to Arbitration Claims which:<br> 
<br> 
</p> 
<ul class="bullet"> 
<li>are based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</li> 
<li>arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li> 
<li>are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</li> 
<li>may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND AT&amp;T ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ARBITRATION CLAIMS. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;). The Notice to AT&amp;T should be addressed to: AT&amp;T Internet Services - Legal Department, 208 S. Akard, Room 3100.04, Dallas, Texas 75202 (&quot;Notice Address&quot;). The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (&quot;Demand&quot;). If AT&amp;T and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or AT&amp;T may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&amp;T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AT&amp;T is entitled.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration from here: <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/public-affairs?pid=11696" data-cqpath="/content/sharedcontent/en/legal/marketing_pages/att-internet-terms-of-service/jcr:content/warrantypar/warrantyinfo;2012108">www.att.com/residentialarbitration</a>.</b><br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. After AT&amp;T receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee. (The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000, but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, AT&amp;T will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. All issues, including the scope of this arbitration provision, are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the arbitrator have the authority to (a) make any award that is in excess of or contrary to what this Agreement provides, or (b) order consolidation or arbitration on a class wide or representative basis. Unless AT&amp;T and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&amp;T will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse AT&amp;T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is:<br> 
<br> 
</p> 
<ul class="bullet"> 
<li>equal to or less than the greater of (1) $5,000 or (2) the maximum claim that may be brought in small claims court in the county of your billing address; and</li> 
<li>greater than the value AT&amp;T's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected,</li> 
</ul> 
<p><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then AT&amp;T will:<br> 
<br> 
</p> 
<ul class="bullet"> 
<li>pay you the greater of (1) $5,000 or (2) the maximum claim that may be brought in small claims court in the county of your billing address (&quot;the premium&quot;) instead of the arbitrator's award; and</li> 
<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses, that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (&quot;the attorney premium&quot;).</li> 
</ul> 
<p><br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If AT&amp;T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the premium and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the premium and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs. Although under some laws AT&amp;T may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&amp;T agrees that it will not seek such an award.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND AT&amp;T AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and AT&amp;T agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&amp;T makes any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the period of time that you are receiving Services, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any such change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.<br> 
<br>
