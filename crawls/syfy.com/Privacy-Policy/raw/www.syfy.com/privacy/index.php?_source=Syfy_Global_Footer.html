As with other sites, you may be able delete any existing cookies placed on your computer by the social network via your browser.</p>
			
			
			<h3 id="1.2">1.2 Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
			
			<p>Like many companies, we use "cookies" or other similar technology (including flash cookies, e-tags, cache browsers and GIFs etc) on the Website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Website before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify Website features in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience, for example, by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, while you are visiting a particular page on this site.</p>
			
			<p>When you visit this site, we automatically collect certain personal information, that we then aggregate so that it is not linked to a single, identifiable individual. This information provides us with statistics such as how many users visit the Website and which pages were accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor this site to our visitors. We may also enter into arrangements with outside companies that possess technology that allows us to customise the advertising and marketing messages you receive on this Website.
