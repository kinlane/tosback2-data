       <p>We do not provide your personally identifiable information to anyone except  as expressly authorized by you or to companies that provide support services to  us. For example, we use third parties to help us fulfill orders, deliver  packages, verify name and address information, analyze customer data and  surveys, process credit card applications and payments and administer our e-mails and the  various online, mobile and other marketing applications and promotions that we  offer from time to time. We may also share your personally identifiable  information with third parties that provide financial products and services  related to our business, such as Kohl&rsquo;s Charge.&nbsp;These companies need some of your personal information  to perform their functions, to fulfill your requests and to make your shopping experience  more satisfying.
       <p>Gift Registry participants acknowledge and agree that their name(s), event  date, state and complete Gift List will be viewable on the Site, our  partnership Gift Registry web sites and/or in Kohl's stores to anyone who  searches, finds and selects the registrants&rsquo; names when using the Gift Registry  feature. If Gift Registry participants do not want this information accessible  on Kohls.com and/or our partnership Gift Registry web sites, they may call  Kohl&rsquo;s Customer Service toll free at (866) 887-8884 to request registry access  be restricted to in-store.
<p>You should also be aware that we may disclose specific information about you  if necessary to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it is  necessary to conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect the  users of our Site, the site or the public.
<p>In the event that Kohl&rsquo;s and/or its affiliates would merge with, acquire or  be acquired by another business entity as well as (or portions through) an  asset sale, some or all of the personal information collected about you could  be shared, as well as retained by Kohl&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Kohl’s makes available its mobile web site and mobile application to you if you choose to use those channels of the Site through a mobile device.  Kohl’s may collect mobile device identification and location-based information in order to provide the specific mobile application location-based service you request.  Such location-based application service requires a location to function properly and your use of the application signifies your agreement to use your location for purposes of the services.  If you do not want Kohl’s to use location-based information, please refrain from using a location-based service on the Site or click “Don’t Allow” when your mobile device requests your location-based information.  Similarly, you may elect to share mobile web site content or the mobile application itself with other users, and those types of services may be provided in the form of text messages delivered to the registered mobile device instead of directly through the installed mobile Site application.  By using those sharing services of the Site, you accept and agree to utilize such SMS-based communications.  If you do not agree to the SMS-based communications, please refrain from using the share or other SMS features of the Site.<br>

      <p>For the purpose of analyzing site traffic and improving this Site, we  collect navigational information when you visit the various pages of our Site  through a computer or mobile device. This information is largely anonymous  because it does not directly identify you, but instead includes data such as,  browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, the site  from which you came, and the site to which you navigate. Because this type of  information does not specifically personally or directly identify you, it is  largely anonymous; however, we may associate this navigational information with  your personal information if you provide it. </p><br>

The cookies used by the Site do not contain any personal  information about you, but they may identify your specific computer. Our site  utilizes two types of cookies:&nbsp; session  cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; A session  cookie exists only for as long as your browser remains open, whereas a  persistent cookie lasts from visit to visit and associates your computer with  the information we may have stored from previous Site visits. Persistent  cookies streamline your navigation of the Site and allow us to give you a more  personalized shopping experience. Managing cookies varies from browser to  browser, so please refer to your browser for further information.&nbsp; If you would like to disable cookies and web  beacons from Kohls.com, please use the help function in your web browser to  restrict cookies from our Site.&nbsp; If you  block cookies from Kohls.com, you may not be able to make purchases or use  other interactive features of our Site.</p>

In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a  unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. We also  use Web beacons provided by the third party to help manage our online advertising.

	   AND TAKEDOWN PROCEDURE</strong></span></p>
	
	   <p>Kohl’s policy is to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and is accessible on this Site, please provide Kohl’s copyright agent the written information specified below.  You agree to comply with this process in the event you are involved in any claim of copyright infringement to which the DMCA may apply.  </p>
	   <p>This procedure is exclusively for notifying Kohl’s that your copyrighted material has been infringed. Kohl’s does not, and will not, make any legal decisions about the validity of your claim of infringement or the possible defenses to a claim. When a clear and valid notice is received pursuant to the guidelines set forth below, Kohl’s will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it. Kohl’s may contact the notice provider to request additional information.  Under the DMCA, Kohl’s is required to take reasonable steps to notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing content (“Alleged Infringer”). The Alleged Infringer is permitted to send Kohl’s a counter-notification.  If you are uncertain whether particular material infringes a copyright held by you or a third party, you should contact an attorney.  Anyone making a false or fraudulent notice or counter-notice may be liable for damages under the DMCA, including costs and attorneys' fees.</p>
	   <p>To be effective under the DMCA, the copyright owner must send a written notice by fax, regular mail, or email only. Kohl’s reserves the right to disregard a notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. </p>
	   <p>A DMCA notice must: 
	   <p>1. Identify specifically the copyrighted work(s) believed to have been infringed;
	   <p>2. Identify the material that is accessible on the Site and which is allegedly infringing upon the copyrighted work(s). The copyright owner must provide detailed information reasonably sufficient to enable Kohl’s to locate the item on the Site, such as clear screenshots of the allegedly infringing materials (for identification purposes); 
	   <p>3. Provide information sufficient to permit Kohl’s to contact the copyright owner directly: name, street address, telephone number, and email (if available); 
	   <p> 4. Provide information sufficient to permit us to notify the Alleged Infringer, if available (preferably, an e-mail address); 
	   <p>5. Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law";
	   <p>6. Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed";
	   <p>7. Be signed by a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner; and

	       <p> <span class="regnocolorbold"><strong><a name="philosophy"></a>OUR PHILOSOPHY</strong></span></p>
		   <p>Kohl's Department Stores is committed to high standards of behavior on issues of social responsibility. Through our Terms of Engagement (&quot;our Policy&quot;), we hold all of our Vendor Partners to these same high standards. Our Policy is designed to protect the interests of workers engaged in the manufacture of merchandise procured for Kohl's and we select Vendor Partners who we believe share our commitment to the fair and ethical treatment of employees. Our compliance philosophy focuses on remediation and continuous improvement.</p>
		   <p> <span class="regnocolorbold"><strong><a name="spolicy"></a>OUR POLICY</strong></span></p>
		   Our Policy focuses on compliance with local labor laws, working conditions and spells out Kohl's expectations to our Vendor Partners regarding wages, prohibition of using child or forced labor which includes, without limitation, prison and slave labor or human trafficking for those purposes, respecting the rights of workers to free association, health and safety issues and more. Our Policy is posted at www.connection.kohls.com ("new vendors" tab).
		   <p>We contract with numerous Vendor Partners who in turn contract with hundreds of manufacturing facilities worldwide to procure merchandise sold in our stores. It is critically important to us that each Vendor Partner's manufacturing facility treats its workers fairly and in compliance with our Policy.
		   <p>We continually monitor social compliance and challenge our Vendor Partners to protect the health, safety and human rights of workers.</p>
		  <h5 align="left">

		   <p> <span class="regnocolorbold"><strong><a name="oversight"></a>OVERSIGHT OF OUR POLICY</strong></span></p>
		   <p>Kohl's organizational structure supports the uniform and objective application of the compliance program to all Vendor Partners. Corporate Governance personnel are responsible for day-to-day duties and administration of the compliance program and are independent of the Product Development and Merchandising departments who are responsible for development, sourcing and merchandising. As a result, day-to-day decisions regarding the social compliance status of potential factories, and those factories that are being used to produce merchandise for Kohl's, are made by employees not involved in actual purchase negotiation.</p>
		   <p>We expect our Vendor partners to take all steps necessary to ensure compliance with our Policy in their manufacturing facilities that produce merchandise for us, whether the facility is operated by them or by one of their subcontractors. We require our Vendor Partners who produce private label and exclusive merchandise for us to identify all manufacturing facilities, domestic and foreign, that they plan to use to produce such merchandise and to provide us with written certification that each facility will operate in compliance with our Policy. Subcontractors that a Vendor Partner desires to use in the manufacturing process require our approval.
		   <p>We recognize that publication of a statement of principles is insufficient to achieve compliance with these principles and that aggressive enforcement of our Policy is required. To achieve this goal, we actively monitor factories in which our merchandise is produced. We reserve the right to review all Vendor Partner facilities, including the use of unannounced on site inspections of manufacturing facilities. Factory monitoring visits are performed by professional, independent third party monitors and is ongoing. Once deemed compliant with our Policy, factories are monitored periodically, based on established risk level. To date, we have performed in excess of 26,000 monitoring visits to over 5,000 manufacturing facilities in 75 countries around the world to ensure compliance with our Policy.
		   <p>Our full-compliance audit program includes fifteen different modules:
		   <p>&bull;Laws and Regulations<br>
		    &bull;Women Rights<br>
&bull;Wages and Benefits<br>&bull;Health and Safety<br>
&bull;Working Hours<br> &bull;Health and Safety - Dormitories<br>

			  <p> <span class="regnocolorbold"><strong><a name="action"></a>CORRECTIVE ACTION AND REMEDIATION</strong></span></p>
			 <p>We require our Vendor Partners to adopt a corrective action plan whenever possible. If noncompliance with Kohl's Policy is identified, we take appropriate action, which, depending on the severity of the deviation, ranges from working with our Vendor Partner to ensure adequate steps are taken to address deficiencies, to canceling affected orders, to terminating our relationship with our Vendor Partner.
			 <p>Follow-up evaluations are completed to verify subsequent adherence to our Policy. When possible, we attempt to bring noncompliant facilities into compliance rather than terminate our business relationship.
	    <p> <span class="regnocolorbold"><strong><a name="education"></a>EDUCATION AND TRAINING</strong></span></p>
			  <p>We provide training to Vendor Partners on our Policy and our expectation of compliance. We regularly communicate with our Vendor Partners on
			  compliance issues. In addition, we conduct numerous individual training sessions for Vendor Partners to promote understanding and compliance with our requirements. The following topics are reviewed during training sessions: expectations for suppliers, policy definitions, best practices, site verification methods, reporting of facility assessments, remediation methods and compliance improvement.
			  <p>We also conduct internal training sessions for product development and buying office employees on the requirements of our Policy on a quarterly basis. We provide relevant Kohl's employees, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products.
			  <p><strong>Vendor Partner Certification of Compliance</strong><br>
Kohl's requires direct suppliers to certify compliance with all laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country or countries in which they do business.
<p><strong>Sustainable Apparel Coalition Member<br></strong>
Kohl's is a Founding Circle member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition which is a group of leading apparel and footwear brands, retailers, manufacturers, non-government organizations (NGO's), academic experts and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The coalition is working on a collaborative approach to reduce the social and environmental impacts of apparel and footwear products sourced and sold worldwide.
<p><strong>Better Work Program Participant</strong><br>
Kohl's participates in the Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) and Better Work Vietnam (BWV) programs, which are International Labour Organization
programs focused on strengthening labor standards in export garment industries in specified countries. Our reliance upon BFC and BWV factory
monitoring results helps reduce 'audit fatigue' and factory monitoring costs which provides factory management with more time to focus on corrective action and sustainable, continuous improvement.
<p><strong>Policy Regarding Cotton From Uzbekistan</strong><br>
Consistent with our commitment to social responsibility, Kohl's does not knowingly carry products that use cotton originating from any country that condones the use of child labor and/or forced labor. Kohl's does not source any Private or Exclusive Brand products from Uzbekistan and, to the best of our knowledge; cotton from Uzbekistan is not used in goods produced for Kohl's in other countries. Until we are convinced that forced child labor is not being used to produce cotton in Uzbekistan, Kohl's specifically prohibits the use of Uzbekistan cotton in the manufacture of merchandise intended for sale in our stores.
<p><strong>Clean Diamonds Trade Act</strong><br>
We require our suppliers of diamonds and jewelry to ensure that the merchandise they sell to Kohl's meets the requirements of the Clean Diamonds Trade Act and the Kimberly Process Certification and that this merchandise does not contain conflict diamonds.
