<h2>I. What Information Does MyLife Collect?</h2>
<p><a name="0.2__DV_M18"></a><a name="0.2__DV_C6"></a>MyLife 
offers a people search service, which allows site visitors and, to a 
greater extent, paid subscribers to find people and see who is looking 
for them as well.  We act as a search engine and also collect information 
directly from our registered members and subscribers, and also from 
public sources.  <a name="0.2__DV_C8"></a></p>
<p><b>A. Information You Provide by Becoming a Registered Member at  MyLife.com</b></p>
<b>(1)   Registered Members.  </b>
As of September 17, 2008, MyLife.com Sites have two kinds of profiles. 
A MyLife.com registered member ("Member") is someone who has created 
an account by registering on our site (as a paid or free member), agreed 
to our <a name="0.2__DV_M52"></a><a href="http://www.mylife.com/user-agreement" target="_blank">User 
Agreement</a>, and personally 
submitted profile information<a name="0.2__DV_C26"></a>, including via the Facebook 
Connect application, where relevant<a name="0.2__DV_M53"></a>. When you register 
for membership on one of our sites, our registration forms collect  
your name, birth date, gender, email address, and zip code. We also 
ask you to voluntarily provide additional information about yourself, 
such as your job and your interests. If you use the Facebook Connect 
function to import information and to create your Member Profile, we 
will collect the following: your full name, gender and date of birth; 
email address; employment and education; certain Facebook profile details; 
relationships; photos / videos; and live stream feeds. 
<p>Every member has a <b>Member Profile</b>, 
which includes the information you provide as noted above, and may also 
be combined with information available to us from various sources in 
the public domain. <a name="0.2__DV_M55"></a>This includes but is not limited to 
photos from other websites you may be a member of. Upon your initial 
registration on MyLife.com, we will scan the internet for other sites 
you have joined and pull photos or other information you may have there, <a name="0.2__DV_C27"></a>

and we will make this information available to you <a name="0.2__DV_M56"></a>to 
fill in missing sections of your <a name="0.2__DV_C29"></a>MyLife profile. You 
can also fill out missing sections of your MyLife profile at any time 
by importing information into your profile via the Facebook Connect 
function: this information will then become a part of you Member Profile 
(Facebook profile information will not be imported into your Member 
Profile without your consent). You can<a name="0.2__DV_M57"></a> edit and/or update 
this information on the MyLife site whenever you choose by going to 
the Edit section of your profile and adjusting the information as you 
wish. This is a valuable service we provide in order to provide the 
most comprehensive results for our people search features.<a name="0.2__DV_C30"></a>  <a name="0.2__DV_M58"></a>The more information you volunteer, 
the more we can tailor the site, updates, and promotions to your interests. </p>
<p><b>(2) Information 
Collected or Generated during People 
Searches.</b> If you perform searches on a name by completing our Who's 
Searching for You<sup>TM</sup> People Search forms, without completing 
our registration process (i.e., you do not create an account), we will 
store the information you enter on the search form only for purposes 
of later tracking whether searches were performed on those data fields.  
We will not create a Member Profile unless you have specifically created 
an account.  However, as noted below, non-members may have <a href="PrivacyPolicy.pub.html#0.2__DV_M125">"Public 
Profiles"</a>, which are populated with publicly available data which 
MyLife is licensed to resell from third party sources.</p>
<p><a name="0.2__DV_M59"></a><b>(3) 
Additional Information Is Collected from Paid Subscribers.  </b>

When you become a paid subscriber at MyLife.com, you will be required 
to provide us with additional contact information, including your name,  
and billing address. We also require other information necessary to 
process your payment (such as a credit card and expiration date).</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that 
whenever you voluntarily provide information in public areas of a MyLife.com 
Site, such as the user profile pages or people search, that information 
can be viewed and possibly used by others, both on the MyLife.com Sites 
and potentially on our partners&#39; sites, such as Wink.com. <b><u>We advise 
users not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email 
address, street address, or instant messenger address (examples of &quot;personally 
identifiable information&quot;) within these public areas that they 
do not wish to share</u></b>. This information should instead be maintained 
in the appropriate email and contact information section of this site, 
which is protected under the terms of this privacy policy.<b><i> </i></b></p>
<p><b>(4) Your Contacts and Email Credentials. </b>
To make the best use of MyLife.com and to help you keep in touch with your contacts and with other Members, we make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books to join you on MyLife.com. At your request we will search your email address book to see if anyone in it is already a Member of MyLife.com; you can also select and/or input your contacts' email addresses manually. Contacts who are not registered Members will receive an email invitation from us on your behalf inviting them to join. We may follow up such invitations with a limited number of reminder emails to some contacts if they do not respond to the initial invitation. Prior to the introduction of our new email integration services as of December 28, 2011, the login credentials you entered when searching your email address book were used only for that purpose and were not stored or shared.  With the introduction of MyLife's new email integration services as set forth above, when you have activated and logged into the new email services, these credentials are stored with the purpose of connecting you to your external email accounts, if you do not log into and activate these email services, your credentials are not stored.
</p>
<p>
When you activate these email services, MyLife will also import the contacts from the various email systems and display them in the "my contacts" section of the website.  An invitation to those people will only be sent on the explicit request of the user.  
<br/>
This contact import feature -- a helpful, easy way to connect with your friends and family and keep everyone updated on your life -- is common on many social networking sites. Information you enter about your contacts is covered by the same privacy policy terms as your own personal information on MyLife.com.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Information 
About You Collected from Publicly Available Sources</b></p>
<p><b>MyLife Public Profiles 
(third party public domain data).</b> In addition to tens of millions 
of Member Profiles, MyLife also has a database of  public domain 
information about more than 200 million adults in the United States, 
which visitors and members can search.   A Public Profile 
is one that has been created by us using public-domain information, 
which we have licensed from third party sources (for display and resale 
on the internet).  People can search on MyLife.com by various parameters 
for people from their past. If people search for you on the internet, 
for example at a search engine such as Google or Yahoo, the search results 
delivered by the third party search engine may include links to your 
public profile at MyLife.com. If you are a Member, they will see your 
Member Profile as well. </p>
<p>Your Member Profile may 
also include addit<a name="0.2__DV_C42"></a>ional public domain information, 
which MyLife.com will make available to you to add to your existing 
<a href="PrivacyPolicy.pub.html#ua-choices">Member Profile</a> .</p>
<p> </p>
<b>C. Information Collected Via Technology</b>
<p><b>(1) Use of Cookies 
and Web Beacons.</b> On the Internet, a &quot;cookie&quot; is a piece 
of information (a file) that a website transfers to a user&#39;s computer 
for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on the internet. 
The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of our site 
involves cookies. Our cookies are tied to personally identifiable information 
that you provide when registering for our service. Cookies help us and 
our advertising service (discussed below) track the frequency and placement 
of advertisements. Cookies also enable us to measure the aggregate or 
total usage and traffic to our site and to specific offerings. This 
aids us in producing content that best meets our users&#39; preferences. 
In order to implement new services, we may use other types of cookies 
as well. We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of 
our site you like best. We may use that information to display advertisements 
that we think will be of particular interest to you. You may configure 
your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality 
of the MyLife.com Sites. To find out more about changing your browser 
to reject cookies, we suggest the <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies" target="_blank">EPIC 
Cookies Page</a><a name="0.2__DV_M94"></a>.</p>
<p><a name="0.2__DV_M95"></a>We also 
employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) 
that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what 
content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, 
similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements 
of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user&#39;s computer 
hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about 
the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information 
gathered by clear gifs to our customers&#39; personally identifiable information 
in order to remember who you are and track your account preferences. <a name="0.2__DV_M96"></a>

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails 
have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness 
of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. 
If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see, <a href="PrivacyPolicy.pub.html#ua-choices">"Your 
Choices"</a> (below). </p>
<p><a name="0.2__DV_M97"></a>Some of 
our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies and Web beacons 
on our site. We have no access to or control over these tracking technologies. 
See <a href="PrivacyPolicy.pub.html#ua-advertising">"Third Party Advertising"</a><a name="0.2__DV_C55"></a> 
(below).</p>
<p><a name="0.2__DV_M99"></a><b>(2) 
Log Files.</b> As is true of most websites, we gather certain information 
automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses<a name="0.2__DV_M100"></a>, browser type, internet service 
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, 
and click stream data.  <a name="0.2__DV_M101"></a>We use this information, 
which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer 
the site, to track users&#39; movements around the site, and to gather demographic 
information about our user base as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="0.2__DV_M102"></a>We do 
not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable 
information.</p>
<p><a name="0.2__DV_M103"></a>We use 
a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally 
identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate 
in order to track the volume of visits, usage of certain features, and 
length of time on site. This information is used to gain insight into 
customer needs and behavior<a name="0.2__DV_M104"></a> in order to help us improve 
the site and services offered.</p>
<p><a name="0.2__DV_M105"></a><b>(3) 
Sites You Visit.</b> As you access our affiliate sites and browse around 
the MyLife Sites, MyLife.com may collect and store information about 
which pages and which affiliate sites you visit and other information 
presented in your browser&#39;s URL address line. MyLife will use this information 
to help determine what our users are most interested in.</p>
	
<h2>II. Does MyLife Use or Share Information About Members and Site Visitors?</h2>	

<p><b>A.  Providing or Marketing Our 
Services.  </b>If you are a registered member, we use the contact 
information we collect from you, as follows: <br></p>

</ul>
<p><a name="0.2__DV_C12"></a><a name="0.2__DV_M29"></a><a name="0.2__DV_M37"></a><a name="0.2__DV_M39"></a><a name="0.2__DV_M40"></a>For paid subscribers, we may 
also use the information you provide us to bill you for products and 
services you have requested, or to notify you of additional products 
and services available to you. </p>
<p>By becoming a Member, 
you agree that we may share this information with our service providers, 
which may include banks and credit card companies we use to process 
your transaction. They are prohibited from using this information for 
any other purpose including their own marketing purposes. </p>
<p><a name="0.2__DV_M60"></a>We may 
also use or disclose your membership registration or other personally

follows:</p>
<p><a name="0.2__DV_M62"></a><a name="0.2__DV_M63"></a><b>B. 
Co-registration with Other Sites.</b> As a Member, we may offer you 
the ability to co-register with select third-party partner sites. In 
some instances where MyLife.com provides co-registration, the co-registration 
partners allow you to opt out of their membership. If you choose to 
co-register with our partners and accept their terms of service, then 
you are automatically registered as a member of their select websites, 
and your personally identifiable information is shared with those organizations. 
As a result, you may receive information from one of these websites 
as any of their members would. We advise you to review their privacy 
and data collection policies for further information. We are not responsible 
for the use of your personally identifiable information by any such 
service provider. In order to cancel your membership with any of these 
partners you will need to go directly to the partner&#39;s site. Examples 
include special discount savings subscription offers from Web Loyalty 
and Lift Media.</p>

<h2>III. How Does MyLife Secure and Store Your Information?</h2>
<p><a name="0.2__DV_M117"></a>The security 
of your personal information is a high priority at MyLife.com. We maintain 
these websites and all associated data with technical, administrative, 
and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, 
destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure. No computer 
system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible 
hazard, but MyLife is committed to providing appropriate security controls 
to protect our websites and their information against foreseeable hazards.  We follow generally accepted industry standards 
to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission 
and once we receive it. But no method of transmission over the internet, 
or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we 
strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal 
information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>
<p>When you submit information 
about yourself to the MyLife.com Sites over the internet, the information 
may travel over many systems that are not under the control of MyLife. 
We take the protection of user data very seriously and to that end provide 
extra assurances that your information will not be intercepted<a name="0.2__DV_C60"></a>.  For<a name="0.2__DV_M118"></a> example, when you enter sensitive information 
(such as credit card information and/or social security number) on our 
registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure 
socket layer technology (SSL). </p>
<p>If you have any questions about privacy 
or security on our website, you can email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@mylife.com" target="_blank">privacy@mylife.com</a><a name="0.2__DV_M121"></a> or contact our Customer Care team at <a name="0.2__DV_C61"></a>

providers. Some of these sites will have their own separate membership 
processes and privacy policies. The MyLife.com Sites do not control 
sites that are operated by others and so cannot be responsible for the

a good idea to check the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use of any site 
before offering any of your personal information.<a name="0.2__DV_M112"></a><a name="0.2__DV_M113"></a></p>
