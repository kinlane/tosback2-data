The services Fox offers include any Fox-branded URL, Premium Subscriptions, which allows users to view premium online content and participate in premium forums, magazine subscriptions, public forums and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Fox in connection with Fox’s business, including when accessed via the Internet, mobile or other devic. (collectively, the "Scout Services"). Fox is part of the United States based operations of News Corporation.</p>
<p>As set forth in our <a href=http://www.scout.com/3/terms-of-service.html>Terms of Use</a>, Scout.com is a general audience website, is not targeted to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes Fox’s collection, use and sharing of personal information about users (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that personal information is not otherwise publicly available on the Site.  This Privacy Policy also describes generally Fox’s practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., user interests, demographics, or Site usage) to the extent such non-personally identifiable information is associated with a particular user or user account.  This Privacy Policy applies to all "users," including visitors (users who use some of the Scout Services without being registered with Fox), "Members" (users who have registered with Fox) and "Subscribers" (Members who have purchased a Premium Subscription or magazine subscription).</p></li>
<p><li>	<b>SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON WEBSITE</b></p>
<p><i>User Submitted Information</i></p>
<p><b>Membership Account Registration Information</b> is the required information that a user must provide to us when they register as a Member with Scout.com ("Member Profile," also called a "user account"), and includes an email address, password and a security question ("Required Registration Information").  When you register you will be required to register with a specific college, NFL, MLB team or high school page ("Preferred Team Website"). The Preferred Team Website may be operated or owned by a third party service provider selected by Fox</p>
<p><b>Premium Subscription Information</b>. If you elect to purchase a Premium Subscription through the Site you will be required to provide personal financial information, including your credit card information, billing address or other payment information (collectively, "Personal Financial Information"), full name, phone number and shipping address in order to purchase such Scout Services. At the time of purchase you will also be requested to select your Premium Subscription type (e.g. Monthly or Annual). <b>Your Premium Subscription will be automatically renewed and the credit card you used to subscribe for such Premium Subscription will be charged per the billing cycle of your selected online Premium Subscription (e.g. Monthly or Annual), unless you cancel the online Premium Subscription prior to the renewal date of your online Premium Subscription</b>. If you have any questions about canceling your online Premium Subscription or our refund policy please refer to our <a href=http://www.scout.com/3/terms-of-service.html>Terms of Use</a>.

<p><b>Public Forum Login Information</b>. If you elect to post comments on any of the public forums provided on the Site you will be required to select a username and provide your email address.  Your username will be public, which means it is available to everyone and will be displayed in search results on Scout.com and on external search engines. Please select your username carefully.</p>
<p>We may also collect user submitted information in an offline or manual format, such as a postcard. In such circumstances, you will be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Privacy Policy and other relevant information.</p>
<p><i>Site Collected Information</i></p>
<p><b>Site Activity Information</b>.  When users visit the Site, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Site, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Fox Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology including cookies), which are small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website. We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the Site, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.</p>
<p>Third-parties that support Scout.com by serving advertisements or providing Scout Services, such as allowing users to share content, view premium content, or post to the forums or tracking aggregate Site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.  Fox does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.  For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see <a href=http://www.aboutads.info/consumers>http://www.aboutads.info/consumerswww.aboutads.info/consumers</a>.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., <a href=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies</a>).  Users can manage the use of Flash technologies with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see <a href=http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html>http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html</a>.  Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through Scout Services.</p>

Fox will not use your personal information in a manner different from what is described in this Privacy Policy without your permission.</p>
<p><b>Privacy Policy Changes</b>.  Fox may modify this Privacy Policy as necessary.  If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use your personal information, we will notify you to seek your consent either through an  email or a prominent posting on the Site.</p>

The Scout Services may also be linked to websites operated by Fox affiliates (i.e., that are part of the News Corporation: "Affiliated <a href=http://www.newscorp.com>Companies</a>") or third parties. Fox is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the Scout Services via a link, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party site.  Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation corporate <a href=http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html>Privacy Principles</a>, users who visit an Affiliated Company website should still refer to the Affiliated Companies’ separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites that do not display or link to this Privacy Policy or have its own privacy statements.</p>
<p><b>Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Third Party. You acknowledge and agree that this Privacy Policy will not apply to any Personal Financial Information that you provide to any independent third party company on the Site and that all payment obligations related to such purchase shall be governed solely by the applicable independent third party company’s privacy policy.  You further acknowledge and agree that Fox will have no liability for or control over such independent third party company’s use or protection of your Personal Financial Information</b>.
