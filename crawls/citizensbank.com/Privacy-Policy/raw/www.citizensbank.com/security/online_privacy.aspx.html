	<h1>Online Privacy Policy (Revised 12/2012)</h1>
<p>We respect and value your privacy.  Our Online Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes and applies to the information we collect from you when you visit our online interfaces (e.g. website or mobile application) owned or controlled by us (“the Site”).  The terms “we,” “our,” and “us” in this Privacy Policy refer to RBS Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and/or its affiliates, divisions, or subsidiaries.  Our Privacy Policy generally describes how we collect, share, use, and protect your information.  If you are a customer who has opened an account or obtained a financial product or service from us for personal, family, or household purposes, our Privacy Notice may apply to you as well and further explains how we may use your information.</p>

<p>By visiting our Site you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy and consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies.</p>

<p><span class="subhead">1. Information That We Collect</span><br />
When you visit our Site, we receive and collect certain information about you.  The information that we receive and collect depends in part on what you do when you visit our Site.  You may be able to improve your experience on our Site when you tell us who you are – for example, by signing up for e-mail or newsletters, applying for products or services, conducting transactions online, making inquiries, or requesting further information about a product or service.</p>

<p>Some of the information you may submit is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not.  Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person.  Examples include your name, phone number, address, and social security number.  It is possible to browse our Site without actively submitting any personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>We may use this information for a number of purposes, for example, to better service your requests and/or inquiries, monitor Site usage and/or performance, improve the customer experience of our Site, ensure technological compatibility with your computer or other electronic or mobile device (collectively “Computer”), protect against fraud or identity theft, protect against or investigate suspected online criminal activity, or conduct aggregate analyses on usage patterns.</p>

<p><b>Automatically Collected Information</b><br />
Every time you visit a Site, some information is automatically collected from you.  This information may include, but is not limited to, some or all of the following items: your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or domain; type and version of Internet browser software and operating system you use; date, time, and duration of your Site access; specific pages, buttons, images, videos, links, or forms that you access while visiting the Site; type of device (e.g. iPad, BlackBerry, iPhone, Android); mobile carrier and/or Internet Service Provider; and demographic information concerning the country of origin of your Computer and the language(s) used by it.</p>

<p><b>Information Collected via Cookies</b><br />
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your Computer to distinguish you from other visitors to our Site.  The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites to collect or track information about your activities while using the website.  We and/or our third party advertising service providers may place cookies or similar files on your hard drive for many of the reasons listed in this Privacy Policy while visiting our Site.  Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their Computers when they visit websites because browsers are typically set to accept cookies.  You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can choose not to accept cookies.  You can also delete cookies from your Computer at any time.  If you refuse cookies, the functionality of our Site may be impacted or become non-functional.  Since every browser and Computer are different, you will need to follow your browser’s instructions for disabling or deleting cookies.</p>

<p><b>Information Collected via Flash Objects and Other Similar Technology</b><br />
In addition to using cookies, we and/or our third party advertising service providers may also use similar technologies to track users’ interactions with our Site.  Some of these technologies include web beacons (transparent graphical images placed on a website), pixels, tags, and Flash objects (also referred to as “Local Shared Objects”).  Please refer to your browser’s instructions to remove cached Sites, history, and images from your Computer.  Deleting or disabling cookies will not remove Flash objects or Local Shared Objects.  Instead refer to Adobe’s website for more information on how to control or disable these items.</p>

<p><b>Additional Information on Online Behavioral Advertising</b><br />
Some of the advertisements that click-through to our Site and/or may be on our Site contain cookies that allow for the monitoring of your response to these advertisements (sometimes referred to as interest-based advertisements).  Our advertisements may also appear on other websites that use the same advertising service providers as us.  These advertising service providers may use your browsing history across websites to choose which advertisements to display to you.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to have us and/or our third party advertising service providers know which advertisements and subsequent websites you have viewed, you may opt-out at <a href="http://www.citizensbank.com/tools/leaving.aspx?url=http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">AboutAds</a> (established by the Digital Advertising Alliance).  The <a href="http://www.citizensbank.com/tools/leaving.aspx?url=http://www.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> website contains important information on cookies, behavioral advertising, and what opting out will and will not do and choices you can make regarding interest-based advertisements.</p>


<p>Please note: opting out of behavioral advertising will not stop you from receiving advertisements.  You will still see the same number of advertisements as before, but they may not be as relevant to you.  If you use other Computers or browsers and want to opt out of interest based advertisements, you will need to repeat this process for each Computer or browser.  If you delete your Cookies and want to continue to be opted out of interest based advertisements you will have to repeat this opt-out process.</p>

<p><b>Some Reasons for Use</b><br/>
We may use these technologies on our Site to verify your identity, remember personal settings including your preferences, to offer you additional options or enhance your online experience, and to improve our products and services.  We may also use them for marketing site personalization, and tracking of online applications and programs and/or track the effectiveness of advertisements for our products and services that we may place on our Site or other linked and/or partner websites.  Cookies used for tracking advertising effectiveness do not collect personally identifiable information.
