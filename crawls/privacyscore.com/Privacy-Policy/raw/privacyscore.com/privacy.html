                We collect limited information.</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Registration Data.</strong> If you sign up for privacyscore services, you
                may provide personal information such as your name and email address. We do not
                associate any of this information with information about your activities through
                our services.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>No Log Files.</strong> We do not log individual clickstream data, such as your IP address, when you use our services.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cookies.</strong> When you use our services, our systems may set a &quot;cookie&quot;
                (a small text file) in your browser, which includes a unique number that helps us recognize your computer from
                page to page and makes it easier to log in. If you are not a registered user, all of these cookies are set to expire when you close your browser. You can delete cookies or set your browser to refuse cookies, although this may impair the functioning of our site. We do not use Flash cookies or other local storage to leave any unique identifier on your computer or device.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Information collected through browser add-ons.</strong> If you use a privacyscore
                browser add-on in the default mode, your browser will ask our server to provide
                a privacyscore for each page that you visit. Your request may transmit the URL of
                the page you are viewing, but this is not stored by us. No cookie or other identifier
                is placed on your computer, and your IP address is not stored.</p>
            <p>
                You have the option to participate anonymously in the privacyscore panel and send tracking data
                to us to make privacyscores better. When this option is enabled, the add-on will
                scan each page that you visit for tracking companies, and send data relating to
                tracking interactions to our database. No cookie or other identifier is placed on
                your computer. Our system may receive an IP address when the add-on requests scores
                or transmits tracking data. We use IP addresses to screen out invalid transmissions,
                so we can ensure the quality of privacyscore results. Our systems are designed so
                that IP addresses cannot be associated with browsing history information. The add-on
                does not operate and does not send data when you are in incognito or private browsing
                mode.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Third-Party Data Collection.</strong> We do not allow any other company
                to collect information through our services for their own use. We may link to third
                parties and these parties may use cookies or other tracking method under their own
                privacy policies.</p>
				 <p>
		                <strong>Analytics.</strong> We use Google Analytics, which Google provides as a
		                free service. Although Google processes and stores usage information about the use
		                of this site (all the same information described above), it does so strictly as
		                our agent. Google has agreed to refrain from
		                any other use or sharing of this information, and Google obscures (or "anonymizes") IP addresses they collect in order to prevent the association of your IP address with your activities on our service. Read <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html"
