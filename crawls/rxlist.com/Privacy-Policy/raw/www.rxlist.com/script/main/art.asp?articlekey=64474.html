We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every Web site that you visit through a link or advertisement on WebMD. </p>
<p>We hope that reading our Privacy Policy helps you understand how we manage information about you. Throughout our Privacy Policy, we have underlined various terms and hot-linked them to our Glossary or to the corresponding Section within the Privacy Policy to help you better understand their meaning. </p>
<p>While you may use some of the functionality of WebMD without registration, many of the specific tools and services on our website require registration.

<p><b><a name="p3"></a>PART 3: Non-Personal Information We Collect About You</b></p>

<p><b>A. Cookies</b></p> 
<p>We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of our Web site and your use of the Web sites of selected sponsors and advertisers through the use of <a href="art.asp%3Farticlekey=64474.html#cookies">Cookies</a>. Every computer that accesses a WebMD Web site is assigned a different Cookie by WebMD. The information collected by Cookies (i) helps us dynamically generate advertising and content on Web pages or in newsletters, (ii) allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our Web site and selected sponsors' and advertisers' sites, (iii) how many people open our emails, and (iv) for what purposes these actions are being taken. We may use Cookie information to deliver certain advertisements to your browser on our owned or operated Web sites based on areas of the Site that you have visited or to determine the popularity of certain content or advertisements. In connection with our sale of advertising we may allow third parties to place a cookie on your browser or a beacon on our site in order to enable advertisers to recognize your browser in order to deliver an advertisement based on non-personally indentifiable information.  Importantly, we do not allow these advertisers to collect any information based on your visits to WebMD.  We may also acquire Non-Personal Information about our users that these or other third parties have access to and we may use that information for the purpose of content development, marketing purposes or the delivery of advertisements. Cookies are also used to facilitate a user's log-in, as navigation aides and as session timers. Cookies used by WebMD and WebMD Health Manager are also used to restrict underage use of the tools. We also use cookies in order to enable us to conduct survey's for our own use and on behalf of our advertisers. These cookies are used to determine whether you have seen certain content or advertising so that we may request your opinions.</p>
<p>Most browser software can be set to reject all Cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our Cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of our Web site may not work properly but you do not have to accept our Cookies in order to productively use our site. Additionally WebMD may geographically target advertising based on your IP address. We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to enable you to use certain interactive tools on our site. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data they collect, and how the data is stored. WebMD does not share information stored in flash cookies with third parties and the data in them is not used by or on behalf of WebMD for delivery of advertisements.</p>

<p>Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.

<p><b>B.  Mobile Device Applications (Apps)</b></p>

This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App.  We do not obtain any information about your mobile device, other than the brand, make and model and type of operating software your device uses.  We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy.  Unlike Cookies the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your browser.  Therefore the random number cannot be removed through settings.  If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use the Mobile Device App and please use your mobile device browser to access our Web sites or our mobile optimized sites.</p>

<p><b><a name="p5"></a>PART 5: WebMD Health Manager - Registration, Use and Tools including Personal Health Record</b></p>
<p>WebMD Health Manager allows you a secure place to store your Personal Health Information and provides tools and services in order to better manage your health and the health of your family. WebMD Health Manager requires additional registration whether you access it through (i) WebMD, (ii) your employer's Web site or (iii) your healthcare sponsor's website.</p>
<p><b>Important Note:</b> If you are an employee or health plan member who has enabled access to your health record at WebMD.com by registering at your employer's or health plan's website, the privacy policy applicable to your information at your employer's or health plan's website remains applicable to your personal health record at WebMD.com. If your employer or health plan account is no longer made available to you by your employer or health plan, you will continue to have access to your health information from your PHR at WebMD.com, using the same username and password. In this situation, the privacy policy that applies to your information will be the privacy policy at the WebMD.com site, www.webmd.com/phr. Except for employees or health plan members covered by their employer's or health plan's privacy policy described above, the following applies to your access to WebMD Health Manager through this site:</p>

<p><b>A. WebMD Health Manager Home Page</b></p>
<p>Personal Health Information that you enter into one of the WebMD Health Manager tools is used to provide you personalized and clinically relevant information on your personalized Health Manager home page and throughout the Health Manager product. WebMD Health Manager creates a personal home page specifically for you. You control and authorize who can gain access to this page. </p>
<p align="right"><a href="art.asp%3Farticlekey=64474.html#top">^ back to top</a></p>

<p><b>B. Concept Unique Identifiers</b></p>
<p>WebMD Health Manager tailors the information you receive on your personal Health Manager home page to reflect your interests, concerns and personal health characteristics. We attach a concept unique identifier (CUI) to every piece of information that you provide us. For example, if you complete the HealthQuotient and indicate that you have diabetes, that single piece of information is tagged with a CUI that is specific to diabetes. Every user that indicates he or she has diabetes receives this CUI tag. Each time you view your personalized Health Manager pages, this CUI tag is matched to content from WebMD about diabetes, and if our automated algorithms determine that this is likely to be an important topic to you, it will appear on your personalized pages </p>
<p align="right"><a href="art.asp%3Farticlekey=64474.html#top">^ back to top</a></p>

<p><b>C. Aggregate Data</b></p>
<p>WebMD Health Manager may combine, in a non-identifiable format, the Personal Health Information you provide with information from other users to create <a href="art.asp%3Farticlekey=64474.html#aggregate">Aggregate Data</a> that may be disclosed to third parties. Aggregate data does not contain any information that could be used to contact or identify you. For example, WebMD Health Manager may use information gathered to create a composite profile of all the users of a particular third party site. These third party Web sites may use this information to understand community needs and to design appropriate programs and activities on their site. WebMD Health Manager will not disclose your Personal Health Information to any third party without your prior permission, except as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p align="right"><a href="art.asp%3Farticlekey=64474.html#top">^ back to top</a></p>

<p><b>D. Secure Message Center</b></p>
<p>WebMD Health Manager has the ability to use Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to send you personalized emails or secure electronic messages. During registration or at anytime, you have the option of choosing whether you receive emails pertaining to your health interests, including news, announcements, reminders and opportunities. The WebMD Health Manager email service requires an "Opt-in" authorization from you. </p>
<p>Information that WebMD Health Manager deems related to your Personal Health Information will be delivered to you through the Secure Message Center on your personal health home page. </p>
<p>If you decide, that you would prefer not to receive personalized email or secure electronic messages through from the WebMD Health Manager tool, you may "Opt-out" of the service by clicking on the settings tab on your Health Manager home page and changing your email preference.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="art.asp%3Farticlekey=64474.html#top">^ back to top</a></p>

<p>Interactive tools within the WebMD Health Manager, gather self-reported Personal Health Information. In addition, certain of these tools can store Personal Health Information coming from third party data interchange agreements between your employer, health plan, pharmacy benefits manager and other third parties that provide data interchange services. We maintain and limit the use of that information to the Opt-in permission you have provided at the time you use the tool. </p>

<p><b><a name="p6"></a>PART 6: Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on WebMD's Behalf</b></p>
<p>Sponsors or advertisers on WebMD may use their own Cookies, Web Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on WebMD and in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Some advertisers use companies other than WebMD to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on our Web site. In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the Web site of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the sponsor, partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its selected destination (e.g., back to WebMD to show the ad, or to the advertiser's website); this re-direction process will not be apparent to you. </p>
<p>We do not control these third parties' use of cookies or Web Beacons, or how they manage the non-personal information they gather through them. However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect cookie or web beacon information through our Web site to agree that they will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from our site without your consent. They have promised us they will not link any non-personal cookie or web beacon information collected by them on our site to Personally Identifiable Information they or others collect in other ways or from other sites except as may be described in connection with a particular program. For example, in connection with "Ad links" furnished by Yahoo, non-personal information sent by your browser to Yahoo when you click on a sponsored link or submit a query may be used by Yahoo as described in its privacy policy. In addition, WebMD's Advertising Policy is posted on our Web site and will provide additional detail about our relationship with advertisers and the companies that serve ads. You should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our site to understand how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies or web beacons on their own sites.

<p><b><a name="p7"></a>PART 7: Disclosure of Your Information</b></p>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, WebMD will not disclose any Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information it gathers from you on our website. We may only release Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information to a third party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order. In addition, we may disclose Personal Information as described below. </p>
<p><b>A. Disclosure to WebMD Health Operations and Maintenance Contractors</b></p>
<p>WebMD operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have limited access to your Personally Identifiable Information in the course of providing products or services to WebMD. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our Web site. Unless you have Opted-out of receiving emails and newsletters from WebMD, these contractors also may have access to your email address to send newsletters or special promotions to you on our behalf or to send emails to you for purposes such as conducting market research on our behalf. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function for WebMD. We also contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors 1) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and 2) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with products and services as required by law. </p>

<p><b><a name="disclosure">B. Disclosure to Third Party Contractor Websites</a></b><p>
<p>Certain content and services offered to you through our website are served on Web sites hosted and operated by a company other than WebMD ("Third Party Contractor Web sites"). WebMD does not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to these Third Party Contractor Web sites without your consent, but you should be aware that any information you disclose once you access these other Web sites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. WebMD does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Contractor Web sites. You should review the privacy policy posted on the other Web site to understand how that Third Party Contractor Website collects and uses your Personally Identifiable Information. WebMD makes an effort to make it obvious to you when you leave our website and enter a Third Party Contractor Web site, either by requiring you to click on a link or by notifying you on the site before you visit the third party site. In addition, if you see a phrase such as "Powered by" or "in association with" followed by the name of a company other than WebMD, then you are on a Web site hosted by a company other than WebMD. </p>
<p>WebMD also provides links to sites provided by Third Party Contractor Websites that have business arrangements with WebMD to pay commissions based on sales of products or services generated through WebMD. An example of this would be "Ad links" from Yahoo on our Search pages. </p>

<p><b>C. Disclosure to or by Co-branded Channel Partners</b></p>
<p>WebMD is a contractor and provides co-branded content and services to Channel Partner Web sites hosted and operated by companies other than WebMD <a href="art.asp%3Farticlekey=64474.html#channel">Channel Partner Websites</a>. You can only access these co-branded content and services only through the Channel Partner Web site, and usually from the health section of these other Web sites. The co-branded WebMD pages that you may access through a Channel Partner Web site may have different registration processes and opportunities for information collection, and Personally Identifiable Information that you provide on these pages may be shared with the Channel Partners. WebMD does not share Personal Health Information with Channel Partner Web sites without your consent. Each of these co-branded WebMD Web sites has its own privacy policy posted on that site, which explains what information is disclosed by WebMD to the Channel Partner and vice versa. If you visit one of these co-branded WebMD sites, please read the privacy policy that is posted on that site, as well as the individual privacy policy of the Channel Partner Web site. </p>

<p><b>D. Disclosure to Linked Sites</b></p>
<p>In addition to the Third Party Contractor Web sites that you may access as described above, for your convenience there are links to Third Party Web sites operated by companies that are not affiliated with the WebMD Web site and that do not have contracts to provide content or services through the WebMD Web site. These links may be found in advertisements, referenced within content, or placed beside the names or logos of sponsors. WebMD does not disclose your Personal Information to these Third Party Websites without obtaining your consent. WebMD does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites.

<p><b>E. Disclosure of Aggregate Information</b></p>
<p>WebMD may provide Aggregate Information to third parties. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our website and the activities they conduct while on our site. We might also inform a pharmaceutical company (that may or may not be an advertiser on our site) that "30% of our users live east of the Mississippi" or that "25% of our users have tried alternative medicine." Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this Aggregate Information. We require parties with whom we share Aggregate Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally identifiable, such as by combining it with other databases. </p>

<p><b><a name="p8"></a>PART 8: How WebMD Handles Privacy and Security Internally</b></p>
<p>Here are some of the security procedures that WebMD uses to protect your privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires both a personal username (log-in name) and a password in order for users to access their Personally Identifiable Information or Personal Health Information. </li>
<li>Requires a public 'nickname' different from the username and password, used for any public forums like message boards. </li>
<li>Uses firewalls to protect information held in our servers. </li>
<li>Utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption in transmitting Personally Identifiable Information to our servers. In order to take advantage of encryption technology, you must have an Internet browser which supports 128-bit encryption. </li>
<li>Closely monitors the limited number of WebMD employees who have potential access to your Personally Identifiable Information. </li>
<li>Requires all WebMD employees to abide by our Privacy Policy and to be subject to disciplinary action if they violate it. </li>
<li>Backs-up our systems to protect the integrity of your Personally Identifiable and Personal Health Information. </li>
</ul>
<p>WebMD Health Manager provides additional protection for your Personal Health Information as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Maintains Audit Trails so you can know who has accessed your WebMD Health Manager record. This can be viewed by clicking on "Activity" in the Settings window, which is accessible from your WebMD Health Manager home page. 
<li>Provides secure messaging within the WebMD Health Manager tool so that information related to your personal health related characteristics is sent through a secure, encrypted connection. 
<li>Provides geographic redundancy of WebMD Health Manager servers, which enhances your ability to access your information by storing identical information at two separate, secure locations. Both sites maintain physical security through pass code locked door access and pass code authority. 
<li>Limits access to Personally Identifiable Information to authorized users. WebMD enables you to have full control over who has access to your Personal Health Information. For example, you may decide to permit your physician or other health care professional access to the personal health information you maintain within our tools. Only the person who creates a record can grant access to other users. </li></ul>
<p>Despite WebMD's efforts to protect your Personally Identifiable Information and Personal Health Information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the Internet may be intercepted.

<p><b><a name="p9"></a>PART 9: Updating Your Information and Contacting WebMD</b></p>
<p><b>A. Updating Your Personally Identifiable Information </b></p>
<p>WebMD tools that collect and store self-reported data allow you to correct, update or review information you have submitted by going back to the specific tool, logging-in and making the desired changes. WebMD may store user submitted data (PII and/or PHI) in an active database for a period of six (6) months.

We place certain restrictions on your ability to correct, update or remove professionally sourced health information that you have authorized to be entered into your WebMD Health Manager record. You may potentially authorize physicians, other health care providers, health plans, hospital systems, pharmacists or laboratories (or their respective Web sites) to provide data into your WebMD Health Manager record.

<p><b><a name="p10"></a>PART 10: Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information - We will inform you if a material change is made to the Privacy Policy, which means a change that expands the permissible uses or disclosures of Personally Identifiable Information allowed by the prior version of the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the WebMD Web site will indicate acceptance of the changes. You may of course choose to Opt-out of continuing to use the WebMD Web site. Please exit the site immediately if you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or any revised policy. </p>
<p>Personal Health Information - We will inform you if a material change in the Privacy Policy is made that involves the use of your Personal Health Information, and your express Opt-in authorization will be requested. If you choose to not accept the new privacy policy, then the current privacy policy conditions will remain in effect, so long as WebMD Health Manager continues to make the functionality available.

<p><b><a name="p11"></a>PART 11: Glossary</b></p>

<p><b><a name="aggregate">Aggregate Information or Data:</a></b> As a Web site gathers individual pieces of Non-Personal Information (see definition below) from its users, it may combine similar data from many or all the users of the Web site into one big "batch". For example, the site may add up the total number of people in Peoria, Illinois, (but not their names) who are seeking information about weight loss and compare that to the number of people in Petaluma, California seeking the same information. 
<p>This sort of statistical information is called aggregate data because it reflects the habits and characteristics of a large group of anonymous people. Web sites may use aggregate data or share it with their business partners so that the information and services they provide best meet the needs of the users. Aggregate data also helps advertisers and sponsors on the Web know how effectively they are reaching and meeting the needs of their target audience. 

<p><b><a name="browser">browser:</a></b> Short for Web browser, a browser is a software application used to locate and display Web (Internet) pages. The most popular browsers are AOL, FireFox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Netscape Navigator. In addition, most modern browsers can present multimedia information, including sound and video, though they require plug-ins for some formats. 

<p><b><a name="cache">cache (also called cache memory):</a></b> Once your Web browser accesses a Web page, it references that page and the graphics on it within your computer's "cache" (or more simply, your computer takes a "snapshot" of every page you visit and stores it in the "cache".) The next time you visit that same page, your download time will be quicker as the images and much of the page is already available on your computer for your browser to reference instantly instead of waiting for the page and images to download again. WebMD Health Manager does not cache pages. 

<p><b><a name="channel">Channel Partner Web site:</a></b> A third party Web site to whom WebMD provides content and services for that web site's health channel. </p>

<p><b><a name="stream">Click Stream Information:</a></b> A record of all the pages you have visited during your visit to a particular Web site or the services you accessed from the site or from an email. Click Stream Information is associated with your browser and not with you personally. It records the archives of your browser. 

<p><b><a name="cookies">Cookie:</a></b> A small data file that is stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a Web site. Cookies are placed by that site or by a third party with a presence on the site, such as an advertiser using a Web Beacon (see definition below) and are accessible only by the party or site that placed the Cookie (i.e. a Cookie placed on your computer by WebMD isn't accessed by any other site you visit but a Cookie placed on your computer by an advertiser may be accessed by any site on which that same advertiser has a presence). Cookies can contain pieces of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). WebMD Health encrypts any PII it stores in its Cookies. These Cookies often are used to make the site easier to use. For example, if you check a box to ask that we store your user name on your computer so that you don't have to enter it each time you visit the site, it's stored in a Cookie on your computer. 

<p><b><a name="encryption">encryption:</a></b> The translation of data into a secret code. Encryption is the most effective way to achieve data security. To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a secret key or password that enables you to decrypt it. Encryption is a common technique for providing security in computer systems. 

<p><b><a name="firewall">firewall:</a></b> A system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a public or private network. Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software, or a combination of both. Firewalls are frequently used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing private portions of public networks. All messages entering or leaving the network pass through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria. 

<p><b><a name="non">Non-Personal Information:</a></b> Information that is not traceable back to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual. For example, Click Stream Information is Non-Personal Information, as is information such as gender, age, city and state when not linked with other Personally Identifiable Information. 

<p><b><a name="optin">Opt-In:</a></b> Means you are actively indicating your preference to participate in a program, email, feature, tool, or enhancement on a Web site. Typically, if you "Opt-in" you must provide certain information, usually Personally Identifiable Information, to the Web site or otherwise actively indicate your choice or preference to participate in the Web site program. For example, if you wish to receive a diabetes newsletter by email from WebMD, you must enter your email address and choose the type of newsletter by checking a box next to a statement such as: "Yes, I'd like to receive a free subscription to WebMD's Diabetes Newsletter." 

<p><b><a name="optout">Opt-Out:</a></b> Means that if you do not take some action you are indicating your preference to participate in a program, email, feature, tool or enhancement on a Web site. Typically, if you "Opt-out" you must uncheck a box next to a stated preference or otherwise take some action to indicate your preference not to participate in a program. For example, if you do not wish to receive promotional emails from WebMD or its sponsors, you must uncheck the box in your email preference center that states: "Please send me special offers and communications from WebMD and/or its partners that would interest me." 

<p><b><a name="password">password:</a></b> A secret series of characters, typically alphanumeric (meaning it consists of both letters and numbers) that enables a user to access a file, computer, or program. The user must enter his or her password before the computer or system will respond to commands. The password helps ensure that unauthorized users do not access the system. In addition, data files and programs may require a password. 
<p>Ideally, the password should be something that nobody could guess. In practice, many people choose a password that is easy to remember, such as their name or their initials. This is one reason it is relatively easy to break into many computer systems. 
<p><b><a name="phi">Personal Health Information (PHI):</a></b> When your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is combined with known health characteristics. For example, if you indicated that you have a certain disease or condition, when that information is combined with your PII, it becomes Personal Health Information. 
<p><b><a name="pii">Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (also called Personal Information):</a></b> Information that can be traced back to an individual (contrast with Non-Personal Information and Aggregate Information). Examples of PII include your name, home address, telephone number, email address, and Social Security number. 
<p>If other pieces of information are linked to PII, they also become PII. For example, if you use a nickname to chat online and give out your real name while chatting, your nickname becomes PII when linked with other PII.

<p><b><a name="security">Security Questions:</a></b> WebMD requires you to answer two security questions, usually called Challenge-Response questions. We will use the answers you provide to these questions to help you in the event you forget your username or password. In order to help maintain your privacy, we require an EXACT match against what you submitted during your registration process. Correct spelling and short answers can help ensure that you will succeed with retrieving your username or resetting your password. 
<p><b><a name="server">server:</a></b> A computer that provides services to other computers. A "Web server" stores Web site files and "serves" them to people who request them. 
<p><b><a name="ssl">SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):</a></b> A security protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private information via the Internet. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that's transferred over the SSL connection. Both Microsoft Internet Explorer (http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/Internet_Explorer.htm) and Netscape Navigator (http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/Navigator.htm) support SSL, and many Web sites use the protocol to obtain confidential user information, such as credit card numbers. By convention, URLs that utilize an SSL connection start with https: instead of http. 
<p><b><a name="username">username:</a></b> A name used to gain access to a computer system or program. Usernames, and often passwords, are required in shared systems, such as the Internet. In most such systems, users can choose their own usernames and passwords. 
<p>Usernames are also required to oist a reply on Health Communities, use certain tools and online services like WebMD Health Manager. 
<p><b><a name="virus">virus:</a></b> A program or piece of code that is loaded onto your computer without your knowledge and runs against your wishes. Viruses can also "replicate" themselves by copying their code to other computers. All computer viruses are manmade. A simple virus that can make a copy of itself over and over again is relatively easy to produce. Even such a simple virus is dangerous because it will quickly use all available memory and bring the system to a halt. An even more dangerous type of virus is one capable of transmitting itself across networks and bypassing security systems. There are numerous virus protection programs available. See the "How You Can Protect Yourself" section. 
<p><b><a name="beacons">Web Beacons</a></b> (also often referenced as "clear GIFs", "Web bugs", "1-by-1 GIFs", "Single-Pixel GIFs", "1 x 1 Pixels", or "clear Pixels"): Tiny graphic image files, imbedded in a Web page in GIF, JPEG or HTML format, that provide a presence on the Web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from the User's browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the type browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any Cookies on the User's computer previously placed by that server. Web Beacons can also be used to place a Cookie on the User's browser</p>
