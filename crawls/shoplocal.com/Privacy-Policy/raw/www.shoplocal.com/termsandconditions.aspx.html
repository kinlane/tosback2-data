This may include information that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name, email address, or postal address.  We use this information to provide you with advertisements, respond to your questions and requests, to provide you with services you requested, and to improve our site, services and offerings, and that of our retail clients.

In addition, we also use software that allows us to infer your general location (e.g., city and state) automatically from your IP address.  If we are unable to infer your location and you do not provide it to us, you may see content related to Chicago, Illinois, or other default locations.  We use location information in order to provide you with advertisements and promotions that are relevant to your geographic area.

        <p class="pb10">
        ShopLocal may occasionally release information about our visitors if required to do so by law or if, in our business judgment, such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to enforce our <a href="termsandconditions.aspx.html#termsOfUse">Terms of Service</a>; or (c) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our Site, us, our affiliates, our officers, directors, employees, representatives, our licensors, our retailer clients, other users, and/or the public.
