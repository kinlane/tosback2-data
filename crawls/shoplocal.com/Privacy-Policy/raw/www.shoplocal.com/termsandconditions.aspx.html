ShopLocal shall not be responsible for any offer, sale, purchase or other transaction made, content posted, or other communications made by anyone posting prices, offering goods or services, advertisements, opportunities, advice, proposals or other information on the Website. Prices and details of offers, promotions, specials and sales may significantly vary from that posted on the Website. Users should call the merchant in advance to confirm.

ShopLocal has no liability or responsibility to users for performance or nonperformance of such activities. If a user views content or receives communications allegedly inconsistent with this Agreement, an e-mail may be sent to info@shoplocal.com stating the observed behavior. Following receipt of such correspondence, decisions will be made regarding user terminations, removal of posted content, or other actions deemed appropriate by ShopLocal in its sole discretion.

Thus, if your browser is Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 6, or later, your browser can electronically interpret the P3P version of our privacy policies.
</p>

<h4 class="pt15">

<p class="pb10">
If you visit the Website, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, address, phone number or email address) unless you provide it.

</h4>
<p class="pb10">

Other examples of non-personally identifiable information include: your ZIP Code and/or City, State; your IP address (a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web; many Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address); your domain type (i.e., .com, .net, .edu, etc.);  or standard information included with every communication sent on the Internet, such as browser type, operating system, browser language, service provider, and local time. ShopLocal collects data from the Web logs of its servers -- the computers that "serve up" Web pages -- delivering the ShopLocal content. This includes information about what you view and, along with information gathered from our other users.  
</p>

<p class="pb10">
We create "aggregate data" reports that we may disclose to third parties, including our clients with whom we have entered into an agreement to provide such information. We may also study aggregate data in order to enhance our existing services or develop new services.

<p class="pb10">
Additionally, we may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to this Website to enable us or a third party to provide you with information while you are using this Website or other websites about products and services.

<p class="pb10">
Also, we use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit our Web site.

We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms of use or to protect our service, site, customers, or other individuals.

<li>
This Website is not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 as part of the Website. We screen users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent users under the age of 13 from providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of 13 as part of the Website, we will delete such information from our records. 
</li>
<li class="pt10">
Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 via the Website, we also do NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties. 
</li>
<li class="pt10">
We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through the Website. 
</li>
<li class="pt10">
