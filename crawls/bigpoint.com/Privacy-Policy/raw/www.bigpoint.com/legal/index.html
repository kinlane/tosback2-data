<br />
7.4 ADJUSTMENT OF FEES AND CHANGES TO PREMIUM SERVICES<br />

If you cancel your subscription, Bigpoint will issue a reimbursement for the pre-paid fees related to that subscription on a pro-rata basis.<br />
<br />
As the Games are developed and improved, Bigpoint reserves the right to discontinue any Premium Features and/or to offer them in the basic version of a Game.

No additional fees will be assessed during the period an account is deactivated. However, Bigpoint may assess a processing fee for deactivating the account, informing you about the deactivation, and for reactivating the account or creating a new account upon full payment. In addition, in case of a chargeback, Bigpoint will impose a service fee of $13.00.<br />

<p class="agbTermText">Bigpoint Inc. provides online games that are true download-free entertainment worlds.
            Information can be processed on an organization's own computers or on computers
            hosted by Bigpoint GmbH, Germany. In the latter case, Bigpoint GmbH is an Application
            Service Provider (ASP).
            <br><br>
            Bigpoint Inc. respects individual privacy and values the confidence of their customers,
            employees, business partners and others. Bigpoint Inc. prides itself on upholding the
            highest ethical standards in its business practices. Bigpoint Inc. shall not knowingly allow

            processing, shall keep such Customer Proprietary Information confidential, and shall not
            disclose any such Customer Proprietary Information for any other purpose unless
            instructions are received in writing from an officer of the Customer. To help ensure and
            protect the confidentiality of a Customer's business and to prevent unauthorized persons
            from gaining access to a Customer's records, Bigpoint Inc. shall adhere to best practice

            As an ASP, Bigpoint Inc. has certain responsibilities for protecting the privacy of a
            Customer's information including any personal information being maintained in an
            Customer's files. Each Customer, as the collector and user of that information, has primary
            responsibility for the privacy of that information. The Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the
            "Policy") sets forth the privacy principles that Bigpoint Inc. follows with respect to personal

<p class="agbTermText">The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed
            on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the "Safe Harbor
            Principles") to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union
            law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU to
            the United States. The EEA also has recognized the U.S. Safe Harbor as providing
            adequate data protection (OJ L 45, 15.2.2001, p.47). Consistent with its commitment to
            protect personal privacy, Bigpoint Inc. adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>

        has not been combined with non-public personal information.
        <br><br>
        "Sensitive personal information" means personal information that reveals race, ethnic
        origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union
        membership, or that concerns an individual's health. In addition, Bigpoint Inc. will treat as

                PRIVACY PRINCIPLES

            parties to which Bigpoint Inc. discloses or may disclose that information, and the choices
            and means, if any, Bigpoint Inc. offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their

            practicable thereafter, and in any event before Bigpoint Inc. uses or discloses the
            information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.
            <br><br>
            Where Bigpoint Inc. receives personal information from their subsidiaries, affiliates or other
            entities in the EU, they will use and disclose such information in accordance with the

            <br><br>
            <b>CHOICE:</b> Bigpoint Inc. will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether
            their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used
            for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently

            which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            <b>DATA INTEGRITY:</b> Bigpoint Inc. will use personal information only in ways that are
            compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the
            individual. Bigpoint Inc. will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is
            relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
            <br><br>
            <b>TRANSFERS TO AGENTS:</b> Bigpoint Inc. will obtain assurances from their agents that
            they will safeguard personal information consistently with this Policy. Examples of
            appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include: a contract obligating the
            agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe
            Harbor Principles, being subject to EU Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Data Protection
            Directive), Safe Harbor certification by the agent, or being subject to another European
            Commission adequacy finding. Where Bigpoint Inc. becomes aware that an agent is using
            or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Policy, Bigpoint Inc. will take
            reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.
            <br><br>
            <b>ACCESS AND CORRECTION:</b> Upon request, Bigpoint Inc. will grant individuals
            reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, Bigpoint
            Inc. will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete
            information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECURITY:</b> Bigpoint Inc. will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information
            in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and
            destruction.
            <br><br>
            <b>ENFORCEMENT:</b> Bigpoint Inc. will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy
            practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Employees will be properly trained to adhere to
            these principles. Any employee that Bigpoint Inc. determines is in violation of this policy
            will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
            Bigpoint Inc. is subject to the laws and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission.
            <br><br>
            <b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION:</b> Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of
