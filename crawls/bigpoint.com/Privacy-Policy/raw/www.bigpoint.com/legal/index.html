<p class="agbTermText">This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal and non-personal information we collect on <a href="http://www.bigpoint.com" target="_blank">www.bigpoint.com</a> and related websites that link to this Privacy Policy (the "Site") and through the registration and use of games developed and/or published by Bigpoint, Inc. (the "Games"), how we use such information and to whom and under what circumstances we may disclose it.  By using the Site and Games, which are operated by Bigpoint Inc. you agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Policy.  In this policy, "Bigpoint" refers to Bigpoint, Inc. and its Affiliates, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership.  We may also refer to Bigpoint as "We" or "Us". If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or Games.
If you access our games from a third party Social Networking Service ("SNS"), you may be required to also read and accept the SNS’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>

                INFORMATION OF CHILDREN UNDER 13*            
        
    
</div>
<p class="agbTermText">Before a child under 13 can use a Game, Bigpoint requires registration and consent from a parent. During the registration process only the child’s account name, the child’s email address, the parent’s email address and the child’s password are collected and stored. If the child is under 13, the age of the child is not stored.
  The registration information is only used to confirm the registration and to send the parent a message asking for consent and allowing the parent to activate the child’s user account.
  Once the parent consents to the registration and storage of personal information of the child, this personal information is only used to provide the Game and related services and to send information about Bigpoint Games. Children’s information is not disclosed to third parties except for purposes of operating and providing the Game as detailed in Section 4. Bigpoint does not condition a child's participation in a Game or activity on the child providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.
  Parents can access any personal information collected online, correct or modify any such personal information, or direct us to delete or make no further use of your child’s or your personal information. To do so, please send an email with your request to stop@bigpoint.com or contact us via phone or mail as detailed in Section 10.
  In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age thirteen without parental consent we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you know or have reason to believe that we might have collected any information from or about a child under thirteen without parental consent, please contact us at stop@bigpoint.com.
  Bigpoint may collect further personal information from the parent as detailed below.
  *Not all Bigpoint Games are suitable for children under the age of 13. Bigpoint restricts access to such games to players that meet the age requirement.</p>

<p class="agbTermText">When you use a Game provided through an SNS such as Facebook, where our games are also reffered to as "applications," you allow Bigpoint to access
certain information from your profile for that site.  The information you allow Bigpoint to access varies by Game and the individual SNS platform.
Additionally the information allowed is affected by the privacy setting that you have established at the SNS.  Information on these settings and how to
change them based on your privacy preferences may be found at the SNS where you play our Game.
By playing a Game through an SNS you are authorizing Bigpoint, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, to collect, store, and use any and
all information that you agreed the SNS may provide Bigpoint through the SNS Application Programming Interface ("API").  The agreement to this Privacy
Policy, the Bigpoint Terms of Service, and any transfer of data from the SNS takes place when you "access" or "allow" (or any similar terms) one of our
applications through an SNS.</p>

Fees for any Premium Feature will be collected from the bank, credit, or debit account you submit until and unless you choose another form of payment or cancel your subscription to such Premium Feature. The name &quot;WWW.BIGPOINT.COM&quot; will appear on your statement.<br />
<br />
7.4 ADJUSTMENT OF FEES AND CHANGES TO PREMIUM SERVICES<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Bigpoint may, at any time, modify the fees for Premium Features or introduce new Premium Features or forms of payment. In the event that Bigpoint modifies the fee for any Premium Feature, Bigpoint will provide notice to users six (6) weeks before the change will take place. The modified fee will take effect on the date indicated in the notice unless you elect to cancel your subscription to the Premium Service in accordance with the instructions set forth in the notice. If you cancel your subscription, Bigpoint will issue a reimbursement for the pre-paid fees related to that subscription on a pro-rata basis.<br />
<br />
As the Games are developed and improved, Bigpoint reserves the right to discontinue any Premium Features and/or to offer them in the basic version of a Game. If you have paid for Premium Features and cannot make use of these Premium Features, either because they are no longer offered or because they have been offered in the basic version as well, or because the game has been suspended, any such purchases of Premium Features are non-refundable.<br />
<br />
7.5 LATE PAYMENT<br />

You are responsible for paying any fees that Bigpoint may incur as a result of attempting to bill you for any Premium Services to which you have subscribed.

No additional fees will be assessed during the period an account is deactivated. However, Bigpoint may assess a processing fee for deactivating the account, informing you about the deactivation, and for reactivating the account or creating a new account upon full payment. In addition, in case of a chargeback, Bigpoint will impose a service fee of $13.00.<br />

            <br><br>
            Bigpoint Inc. respects individual privacy and values the confidence of their customers,

            law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU to
            the United States. The EEA also has recognized the U.S. Safe Harbor as providing
            adequate data protection (OJ L 45, 15.2.2001, p.47). Consistent with its commitment to
            protect personal privacy, Bigpoint Inc. adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>

            individual. Bigpoint Inc. will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is
            relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

            <b>TRANSFERS TO AGENTS:</b> Bigpoint Inc. will obtain assurances from their agents that

            Directive), Safe Harbor certification by the agent, or being subject to another European
            Commission adequacy finding. Where Bigpoint Inc. becomes aware that an agent is using

            reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, Bigpoint
            Inc. will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete
            information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.
            <br><br>
            <b>SECURITY:</b> Bigpoint Inc. will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information
            in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and
            destruction.
            <br><br>
            <b>ENFORCEMENT:</b> Bigpoint Inc. will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy
            practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Employees will be properly trained to adhere to
            these principles. Any employee that Bigpoint Inc. determines is in violation of this policy
            will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
            Bigpoint Inc. is subject to the laws and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission.
            <br><br>
            <b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION:</b> Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of
            personal information should be directed to the Bigpoint Inc. Privacy Office at the address
