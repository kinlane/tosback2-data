				<h2>
					Data collection and sharing involving third parties
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Advertisers and advertising networks place ads (including sponsored links in search results) on our site and in our mobile applications. These companies as well as data analytics companies who service them may collect information, such as your computerâ€™s IP address, browser information, mobile device ID, and search queries, as you use our services. They also may use web technologies such as <a href="privacy_policy.html%3Fv1.html#cookies">cookies and pixel tags</a> to collect data about you when you visit our site.

					<li>We use outside vendors for a variety of purposes, such as to send you emails and messages on behalf of other Ask community members, push notifications to your mobile device on our behalf, provide voice recognition services to process your spoken queries and questions, and help us analyze use of our services. Some of our products, services and databases are hosted by third party hosting services providers. We also may use vendors for other projects, such as conducting surveys or organizing sweepstakes for us, that involve collection of information from our users. We may share information about you with these vendors to enable them to perform their services.
					</li>
					<li>We have contracts with all of these companies that prohibit them from sharing the information about you that they collect or that we provide to them with anyone else, or using it for other purposes.
					</li>
					<li>We will not share information we collected about you with any third party for other purposes (including direct marketing) without first obtaining your consent.
					</li>
					<li>We may disclose data we collect about our users when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety, rights, or property of us, our users, or others.
					</li>
					<li>We may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).

				<h2>
					Security of the information we collect
				</h2>We have implemented security measures to prevent unauthorized or unlawful access to and misuse of the information we collect, including technological and physical security measures as well as procedural safeguards.

				<h2>
					Cookies, pixel tags and mobile device IDs
				</h2>A <strong>cookie</strong> is a small text file that is stored on your computer.
				<ul>
					<li>Ask.com cookies enable us to recognize you (for example, as a registered user) when you visit our website and to store your preferences and settings.
