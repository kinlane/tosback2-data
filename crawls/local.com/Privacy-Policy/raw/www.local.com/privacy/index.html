            Search Pages, the "Local Web Pages"). This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the collection, maintenance, use, and sharing of information
            from the Service.
          </p>
          <p class="pB10">
            In accessing the Service and/or the Local Web Pages, you accept all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy may change from
            time to time, and those changes will be available for your review on our Local mobile applications, on most Local Web Pages that you view and on our web

            continued use of our Service after any such changes have been made will signify your assent to the changed Privacy Policy. Accordingly, we ask that you
            bookmark and periodically review this Privacy Policy to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version. If you do not agree with the terms and
            conditions of this Privacy Policy we request that you immediately cease using and accessing the Service and the Local Web Pages.

          <p class="pB10">
            Please note that we have special concerns about the privacy of users who are minors (under the age of 18 in the US or under the age of 16 in the UK, each

          </p>

            Additionally, Section 12 of this Privacy Policy contains UK-specific privacy terms that apply only to users who access our services via the UK, including

            Most, if not all, of the advertisements appearing on the Service are delivered to you by one of our Web advertising partners ("Ad Serving Partners"). In

          <h5>3. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE GATHER</h5>
          <p>
            Broadly speaking, we use Personal Information and Anonymous Information for purposes of administering our business activities and making available other
            products and services to our visitors and prospective visitors. Most of the Anonymous Information collected is used to operate, develop, and improve our
            products and services. For example, Local may use your IP address to determine which language to use to provide you with Internet search results or to
            advise you how far a particular vendor is from your location. In addition, information collected from end-users may be used in aggregate form to, among
            other things, determine the total number of end-users who are using our Service, prepare utilization reports for our Partners, diagnose and fix
            compatibility problems or other problems with our Service, and perform statistical analyses to enable us to build higher quality, more useful online
            services. We may use Personal Information and Anonymous Information that you provide to us to process account transactions that you request or authorize,
            to make you aware of new or other services that we offer, or to help conduct surveys to assess and improve our Service. The information collected from
            end-users also allows us to deliver search results pages that are as responsive as possible to an individual end-user's particular search query of the
            content of the page such end-user is viewing (for example, serving results in the end-user's native language and tailored to the end-user's country of
            connectivity). We may use the Anonymous Information collected from you to show advertising and promotions tailored to your interests. If you submit a
            request for information about Local through our web site or mobile application(s), we may use your e-mail address to send you an e-mail that gives you the
            opportunity to elect to receive periodic e-mail alerts from Local regarding developments at the company. In addition, if you elect to receive promotional
            information from Local when you create a Local Account, we will use the information you provided to Local during the Local Account creation process to send
            you only promotions that will be most relevant to you. We do not collect or provide e-mail alerts, promotions or advertising based on your Personal
            Information without your permission.

          <h5>4. WHEN WE DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION WE GATHER</h5>
          <p class="pB10">
            As a general rule, we do not share the Personal Information we collect from end-users with third-parties. We may disclose Personal Information if it is
            required by law, necessary to defend our legal rights or enforce our policies, or if we in good faith believe it is appropriate to cooperate in
            investigations of fraud or other illegal activity in which you may be involved (or are reasonably suspected to be involved), even without a subpoena,
            warrant or court order. Such Personal Information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
          </p>
          <p class="pB10">
            We reserve the right to share Anonymous Information with others. Examples of this include the number of users who searched for "used cars" or how many
            users clicked on a particular advertisement. When users submit a search query on our Service, Anonymous Information, such as IP addresses and search terms
            or phrases, is transmitted to certain Partners with whom Local has subcontracted so that those Partners can deliver responsive Internet search results,
            advertising, or other services and, in some cases, for the internal data reporting purposes of those Partners. In addition, some of the Anonymous
            Information is provided to our Partners for purposes of calculating amounts owed to such Partners or helping such Partners improve their services. Our
            Partners are obligated by applicable law to protect the privacy of certain types of data; however, we are not responsible for their actions or omissions,
            including the manner in which they use information that they receive from us. Nevertheless, if you feel that any of our Partners, or any third party who
            claims association with Local, is improperly collecting or using information about you, we urge you to contact them directly and also to inform us by
            e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@local.com">privacy@local.com</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="pB10">
            In addition, if in the future we sell or transfer assets or portions of our business, or if we experience a change in control, reorganization or

          <p>
            If you have a Local Account with us, you have the ability to review and update your Personal Information online by clicking on a "My Account" link (or
          similar link) on the Service and logging into your Local Account. You can also review and update your Personal Information by contacting us at  <a href="mailto:privacy@local.com">privacy@local.com</a>. Generally, we will not modify your Personal Information because it is very difficult to verify
            your identity remotely. You must promptly update your Personal Information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be
            able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your Local Account and remove your Personal Information from view as soon as reasonably
            possible, based on your Local Account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain Personal Information from closed Local Accounts to
            comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our terms and
            conditions, and take other actions permitted by law.

          <p>
            We may make chat rooms, message boards, news groups, and other community services available to you through the Service. If you have a Local Account with
            Local, you can post reviews of businesses to the Service, which we then store, and participate in the community services. Postings and activities in the
            community services are governed by our <a href="http://www.local.com/Terms.aspx">Terms of Service</a>. Please understand that any information that is
            disclosed in these areas becomes public information, and the postings may appear on other third-party websites or when searches are executed on the subject
            of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose Personal Information in a review, that information will be publicly available and can be collected
            and used by others. For example, if you post your email address in a review, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your review
            or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily provide using the community services, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and
            caution with respect to your Personal Information. We may sell your reviews to third-parties. The information presented in the community service areas
            reflects the views of the individual users or hosts and does not necessarily reflect our views or the views of any of our affiliates.

            employees, and consultants. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your Personal
            Information. While we take precautions against possible breaches in our Service and customer databases, no website or Internet transmission is completely
            secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. Your use of our Service and the
            Local Web Pages is at your own risk. We urge you to take steps to protect your Personal Information when you are on the Internet by changing your passwords
            often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure Internet browser.

            Certain of our Partners who provide or enable any functionality on the Service may also require that you download certain software or collect information
            from you, including Personal Information. We are not responsible for the contents of any software download or the privacy practices of our Partners. In
            addition, any web sites that you click to from one of our Results Pages may have been developed by third-parties over which we exercise no control. Such
            web sites may send their own cookies to end-users, collect data, or solicit Personal Information from you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices
            or the content of such web sites, including such web sites' use of any information collected when our end-users click through to such web sites. If you are
