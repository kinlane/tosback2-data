                          <i>Updated May 2008</i> 
                        <p>ZEDO, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of 
                          online consumers. This notice explains our online technology 
                          and information collection practices. </p>
                        <p><strong>Privacy Compliance</strong> <br>
                          ZEDO does not collect any personally identifiable information 
                          (PII) from users. ZEDO adheres to the privacy guidelines 
                          created by the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) and 
                          the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). </p>
                        <p><strong>Information Collection</strong><br>
                          ZEDO is a technology service provider: when you see 
                          an Internet ad &#8216;Powered by ZEDO&#8217;, the Web 
                          site you are on has asked ZEDO to act as an agent for 
                          ad delivery and reporting. The website may be one of 
                          the following: a ZEDO customer; serving ads from one 
                          of ZEDO&#8217;s Ad Network customers; or serving ads 
                          from the ZEDO Ad Network itself. The information ZEDO 
                          processes on a customer&#8217;s behalf belongs to that 
                          customer and is only used by ZEDO to customize ad serving 
                          for that customer. This usage is governed by our Terms 
                          and Conditions with our customers and by this privacy 
                          policy </p>
                        <p>ZEDO collects anonymous information through the use 
                          of cookies and pixel tags, which are industry standard 
                          technologies used by many major Web sites. No personally 
                          identifiable information is collected or used in this 
                          process. </p>
                        <blockquote> 
                          <p> <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
                            Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer: 
                            A cookie file simply contains a string of alphanumeric 
                            characters, which is passed from a Web site to your 
                            computer and back to the Web site, unchanged, for 
                            recognition purposes. Web sites use cookies to recognize 
                            a computer that has previously visited the site or 
                            page. Cookies are often wrongly categorized as &#8216;Spyware&#8217;, 
                            or as a virus or other malicious program. A cookie 
                            itself cannot do anything except help a Web site behave 
                            in a manner customized to you. </p>
                          <p>ZEDO uses cookies to enhance the Web experience by 
                            preventing users from seeing the same Internet ad 
                            over and over again. ZEDO does not use cookies to 
                            personally identify you in any way, and these cookies 
                            cannot damage your system or files. </p>
                          <p>You can tell your browser to accept or reject cookies 
                            for all sites, or for specific sites; but remember, 
                            rejecting cookies may affect the way your favorite 
                            sites behave.</p>
                          <p><strong>Pixel Tags</strong> <br>
                            To make certain that ads served by ZEDO, Inc. are 
                            targeted correctly, partner Web sites in the ZEDO 
                            network place pixel tags on their sites. These tags 
                            are not personally identifiable, nor do they collect 
                            personal information. They are used to match visitor 
                            browsing behavior to a segment profile designated 
                            for targeting ads to visitors. </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>When you are on one of our customer&#8217;s Web sites 
                          (including advertisers and Web site owners), the Web 
                          site uses cookies to collect certain non-personal information 
                          about you, including but not limited to: your browser 
                          type (Internet Explorer, Mozilla, etc.); operating system 
                          (Windows, Macintosh, etc.); your browsing behavior, 
                          such as the date and time you visit the site, the content 
                          areas or pages of the site you visit (for example, &#8216;auto 
                          section&#8217; or &#8216;entertainment section&#8217;), 
                          ads clicked on and other click-stream data. None of 
                          this data contains personal information about you. </p>
                        <p><strong>Usage of Data</strong> <br>
                          ZEDO enables its customers to use the anonymous information 
                          it collects to customize the advertisements that consumers 
                          see on participating Web sites and to analyze if the 
                          advertising resulted in a desired action, such as a 
                          sale. This is sometimes referred to as Online Preference 
                          Marketing (OPM) or Behavioral Targeting. In order to 
                          serve appropriate ads to visitors, ZEDO will temporarily 
                          assemble non-personal behavioral and technical information 
                          to create very large audience segments. These segments 
                          represent data that has been aggregated into large anonymous 
                          groupings. </p>
                        <p>ZEDO stores all anonymous, non PII data in user cookies 
                          and not on any servers. These cookies have a lifetime 
                          of one year and can be blocked or deleted by users using 
                          the methods described on our Opt Out page. <a href="http://www.zedo.com/tools/zedo_optout.cgi">Click

                        <p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong><br>
                          ZEDO does not provide any personal information to marketers 
                          when you interact with or view a targeted ad. The user 
                          information that we collect to create segments and profile 
                          information for our service is shared with our contracted 
                          customers and not with any other outside party. At the 
                          same time, our advertiser customers cannot correlate 
                          or merge any network segment information that they may 
                          collect, process or store in connection with their site, 
                          including such personal information except in compliance 
                          with the applicable customer contracts and such customer&#8217;s 
                          privacy policy. PII may be utilized by advertiser customers 
                          at a later time, as part of their customer relationship 
                          management (CRM) programs, for example. </p>
                        <p>Opting Out<br>

                          browser, you can easily deny, or opt out of, cookies. 
                          There is more than one way to opt out of cookies: manually 
                          delete your cookies by following the instructions contained

                          this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task 
                          again.</p>
