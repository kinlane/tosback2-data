This Privacy Policy applies solely to information that we collect about you as a user of the services provided via the Classmates.com website (the "Website") and/or various applications and tools (including schoolFeed) that we operate on third party websites and devices, such as Facebook, smartphones or tablets (such services offered through the Website, applications or tools collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Service. Each time you use the Services, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.

When You Register</strong></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 11.25pt"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana"> When you register for Services directly on the Website, you may be required to provide certain information, such as your name, maiden name (if applicable), mailing address and/or zip code, email address, phone number, birth date or year, marital status, password, and one or more community affiliations (such as with a school or college). You may also be presented with the option to register for the Services using your Facebook login credentials or similar login processes or co-registration forms from or on other third party websites, in which case you will be authorizing us to access certain information from your current profile on Facebook or other third party website (which will be specified in such login process) for purposes of completing your registration. In addition, when you install certain of our applications on Facebook or other third party websites or devices, you will also be registering for the Services by agreeing to such installation, which takes place when you "accept", "install" or "allow" (or similar language) such application. Each such application includes a disclosure that this registration will occur upon the acceptance, installation or allowance of the application. <br/> <br/> Please keep in mind that, although much of the information described above will not be viewable by other members, once you are registered your name, community affiliations and years associated with those affiliations will be displayed on the Website and you will no longer be anonymous to us or to other individuals who access the Website. In addition, because this information is publicly displayed on the Website, it may be included in the Website "search" tools and on third party websites and devices as described in Section 2(i) below. We may also publicly display your general geographic location based upon the zip code or other geographical information provided to us, as another means of assisting members in finding each other. However, you have the option of opting out of having your general geographic location publicly displayed by accessing your privacy settings on the Website and changing your preferences. In addition, some of our Services may only be accessible if, based on information you have provided to us, you have an affiliation related to our Services. <br/> <br/> <strong>b. When You Accept an Application</strong></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 11.25pt"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana"> Some third party websites, such as Facebook, provide their users with access to applications or other tools, such as "social login", which allow that website's users to share certain personal information with us. When you accept or allow one of our applications or use another tool to create a connection between us and Facebook or other third party website, you authorize us to collect, store and use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy) all information that you agreed Facebook or other third party website could provide to us. If you choose to remove or delete any such application on, or otherwise break our connection with your account on, Facebook or other third party website, we will no longer be able to continue to collect your information from that website. However, deletion or removal of such application does not delete your account from the Website, and we will continue to store and use information that we have previously collected. You can of course edit or delete your profile information on the Website at any time (see Section 3 below). In addition, acceptance of one of our applications may authorize us to automatically post information to your profile on Facebook or other third party website about certain of your activities, such as looking at a reunion, joining a community affiliation, viewing a yearbook, tagging someone in a yearbook, becoming a reunion organizer, updating the details of a reunion, responding to a reunion invitation or tagging someone as "remembered". We may also provide you with the option to post additional information about your activities or information you have found through the Services to your profile on Facebook or other third party website. </span></p><br/> <strong>c. When You "Surf" the Website</strong></span></p><br/> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 11.25pt"><em><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana">Log Files</span></em><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana"><br/> <br/> As is the case with most standard website servers, we use and maintain the information that we obtain from and through your browser on our server logs. This information can include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider ("ISP"), and other data. We may use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track user movement, detect fraud or other types of abuse, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may associate this information with your information to resolve technical issues, support security for our users, and take action on any activity that may violate this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service.<br/> <br/> <em>Cookies</em></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 11.25pt"> </p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 11.25pt"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana"><br/> A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored in a browser-related file on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and are read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. We link cookies to your unique registration number and use them to enhance and personalize your experience on the Services, including helping authenticate you when you use the Services, remembering your preferences and registration information, and customizing the content and advertisements provided to you via the Services. For example, storing a cookie on your computer allows you to login without typing the registered email address or registration number and password. We also use cookies to deliver information and content specific to your interests through the Services. We (or our third party service providers) may also use cookies to target advertisements for the Services that you may view when visiting other websites. If you do not want these cookies stored on your computer you can delete and/or reject cookies by modifying your Internet browser setting accordingly (each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences). However, if you choose to delete and/or reject cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use certain portions of the Services. Please also note that certain types of emails available through the Services may automatically log you into the Services and/or set new cookies when you click on the links in the emails and that you may need to manually remove such cookies if you do not want them to be stored on your computer. See Section 2(d) below for additional information about cookies in regards to our use of third party ad servers.<br/> <br/> <em>Web Beacons</em></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 11.25pt"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana"><br/> A web beacon (also known as a clear gif) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier that is placed on a web page or within an email. It is similar in function to a cookie, and is used to collect a limited set of information, such as a cookie number, time and date of page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. We (and our third party advertisers) may use web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them. This information helps us better manage content available on the Services by informing us about what content is effective and of interest to users. In addition, we may use web beacons in our promotional email messages to keep track of how many messages and which emails have been opened and acted upon. This use allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and our marketing campaigns. We associate web beacons with individual members for internal purposes only, in an effort to understand our members' individual preferences with our email products..</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 11.25pt"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana"><br/> <strong>d.

We may also require other information necessary for you to receive the product, access the paid Service and/or process any applicable payment, such as a credit card or debit card number and expiration date. We may use the information that you provide to us to bill you for products and paid Services you request, or to notify you of additional products and paid Services we may offer. When you sign-up for a product or paid Service, you are consenting to our delivery of this information to our service providers, which may include banks and credit card companies that we use to process a transaction or other third parties who may provide all or a portion of the underlying product or paid Services on our behalf. See Section 2(f) below for additional information about sharing your information with our service providers. We may also show your membership status through the Services so that other members can see what options they have to contact or communicate with you. <br/> <br/> <strong>e.

When using these member-to-member communications, it is up to you to choose when you are comfortable disclosing your email address, or any other personal contact information, to others. We respect the privacy of these member-to-member communications and do not read or disclose them unless we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of this Privacy Policy and/or our Terms of Service, or as otherwise permitted or required under Section 2(h) below.

Because this information is publicly displayed through the Services, it may be included in the Services search tools and on third party websites and devices as described in Section 2(i) below. Please keep in mind that, because of the interactive nature of these forums, in many cases you will not be able to remove or revise the information or content that you submit in these areas of the Services and such information or content may remain on the Services even if your membership is terminated. To protect the privacy of our members, we do not allow the public posting of personal contact information. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content within the comment fields, message boards, events and other public forums on the Services. Please review our "Community Guidelines" (found in our Terms of Services) for more information regarding your appropriate use of these areas.<br/> <br/> <strong>g.

We ask for this information for the sole purpose of sending these emails and tracking the success of our email referral program.<br/> <br/> <strong>h. When You Build a Personal Profile</strong><br/> <br/> We have created tools to enable you to build a personal profile to share as much information about yourself as you wish. Except as otherwise noted, when you use a specific profile tool all information that you add to your profile is publicly viewable and may be included in the Services search tools and on third party websites and devices as described in Section 2(i) below. For this reason, please use care in providing information that you may not want to publicly disclose. To protect the privacy of our members, we do not allow the public posting of personal contact information. Additionally, please see the Community Guidelines in our Terms of Service for more information regarding the limitations on the types of information that you may post on your personal profile and elsewhere on the Services. As provided in our Terms of Service, we may use the information you provide in your profile in a variety of our products and features, such as affiliation-specific emails. This enables us to provide our members with information in a more personalized fashion.

When you participate in a survey, we may request personal contact information (such as your name and email address) or demographic information (such as your zip code, age or income level). We conduct surveys relating to the Services in order to target advertising and content and to better understand members' needs and opinions. We may share, in aggregate form, information we collect from these surveys with our advertisers, partners, affiliates and the general public, but we will not share survey information containing personally identifiable information with any third party without your prior consent.

Third Party Offers</strong><br/> <br/> We may provide you with offers of products and services available from other companies, such as our marketing partners and companies that are affiliated with us ("affiliates"), through the Services. Whether or not you decide to participate in any such offer is up to you. If you sign-up for or purchase a product or service from a third party which requires you to submit personally identifiable information, you are also consenting to our delivery of this information to that party. The offer will notify you if any personally identifiable information will be shared. Such third party will be authorized to use this information in keeping with our contractual relationship with them and in accordance with their own privacy policy and information practices. We do not control these third parties and you agree that we are not liable for their acts or any failure to act on their part.<br/> <br/> <strong>c.

We do share certain aggregate information, such as demographic information and the number of times that our members have viewed an advertisement, with our third party advertisers. This information is not linked with any personally identifiable information, and we do not provide any such information to third party advertisers except as otherwise noted in Section 2(b) above. <br/><br/> We may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our membership and to establish advertising and other business relationships with third parties. We may serve you with targeted advertisements based on your personal information, but we do not provide any of your personal information to an advertiser or any third party with the exception of those uses expressly disclosed in this Privacy Policy. However, if you click an advertisement on the Services, then you consent to the possibility that the advertiser may assume that you meet the targeting criteria, if any, that we use to display such advertisement and, as described above, you will be subject to the advertiser's privacy policy and information collection practices.<br/> <br/> <strong>d. Third Party Ad Servers and Networks</strong><br/> <br/> We may allow other companies, called third party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on the Services. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. We may share certain limited categories of information about you, such as your gender, age or geographic location, with ad networks to help them deliver more relevant advertisements through their ad networks. We do not have access to or control over the cookies that may be placed by these parties on your computer, and have no control over these parties' privacy policies or information collection practices.

We use the information collected in the entry form to verify the entrant's identity and age and to communicate with the entrant. We will not share any of the entrant's personal information with any third party except to service providers (if any) as described below, as disclosed at the time of entry, if you are a contest winner, or as may be required by law.

In these cases, we may provide your personal information to these service providers as needed for the Service to be provided. However, these third parties or affiliates are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information and are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using this information for any other purposes.<br/> <br/> We may provide certain portions of your information, such as your e-mail address or name, back to your Internet service provider ("ISP") if we have an existing advertising relationship with them. This is done to allow them to target or discontinue your exposure to our advertisements, once you have become a participating member of the Services. As part of our agreement with your ISP, they will be required to maintain this information in a confidential manner and use it solely for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 11.25pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana"><strong>g.

Additionally, we may disclose your personal information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety or any person or property if we believe that your personal information in any way relates to that threat.</span></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 11.25pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana"><strong>i.

Some or all of this same information may also be displayed in the results of searches on third party websites that provide people search and other similar services in order to make it easier for people to find you on the Services. If you do not wish to have your information displayed on these search engines or other third party websites, you can opt out by removing your account from the Services. In addition, we may create applications or other tools for use on various third party websites and devices, such as Facebook, smartphones or tablets, through which certain portions of your information that is publicly displayed on the Services may be shown to the users of those websites or devices who are not members of the Services. If you do not wish to have your personal information appear through these applications or tools, you can opt out of having your personal information used in this way by accessing the "Account" or similar section on the Website and changing your preferences.

We may also send certain "welcome" messages that are informational and provide useful details about your membership or product usage instructions when you sign up for a membership or begin using a particular service. In addition, upon registration you may be automatically enrolled in one or more of our regularly recurring email subscription programs. You may also choose to participate in other email subscription programs that we may make available to you. We also may send you communications regarding special offers or other promotional material for our products or Services or those of our affiliated companies or advertisers. We may send all of these communications to the primary email address that you provide to us or to any secondary email address that you may have provided to us if we have determined that your primary email address appears to no longer be valid or otherwise functioning properly. We may also send these communications to your inbox on the Services. <br/><br/> While we reserve the right to send you our customary business communications, "welcome" messages and other transactional emails without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them, we do provide you with the opportunity to select whether or not you wish to continue to receive our subscription-based or commercial emails. Each subscription-based email communication from us contains instructions on how you can remove yourself from the mailing list for that specific email subscription program, and each commercial email contains instructions on how you can opt out of receiving further commercial emails from us. Except for schoolFeed subscription-based emails (which contain unsubscribe links within the emails themselves), you can also update your email preferences by logging onto the "Account" section on the Services. Please keep in mind that any changes that you make to your email preferences may take up to ten (10) business days to process and that each subscription-based email and all commercial emails have their own separate opt-out processes.

For example, highly confidential information, such as a credit card or debit card number, is encrypted before being transmitted through the Services. You may also be required to use a password to access certain pages on the Services where certain types of your personal information can be changed or deleted. It is therefore important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password, to emails which we may send you, and to your computer. You take full responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. Furthermore, while we have implemented safeguards, you should be aware that Internet security technology rapidly changes. We cannot guarantee that the safeguards we employ today can protect your personal information from the threats of tomorrow. You should also be aware that despite our efforts, factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of your personal information.
