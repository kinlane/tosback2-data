    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p>In order to offer and provide a customized and personal service, we may use cookies to store and help track information about you. Cookies are simply small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to help remind us who you are and to help you navigate our sites during your visits. Cookies allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so you won't have to reenter them each time you visit.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The use of cookies is relatively standard. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, if you prefer, you can set your browser to either notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that some features of many sites may not function properly if you don't accept cookies.</p>
    
    <h4>Third Party Services</h4>
    <p>We may use services hosted by third parties such as Google Analytics, to assist in providing our services and to help us understand our customers’ use of our products.  These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including your IP address or cookies.  If these third party services collect information, they do so anonymously and in the aggregate to provide information helpful to us such as website trends, without identifying individual visitors.  Please see “Cookies” in the section above for information on how you can control the use of cookies on your computer.</p>

    <h3>HOW DOES WEST PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IT COLLECTS?</h3>
    <p>We have implemented certain appropriate security measures to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, some of our websites are protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Also, we store the information about you in a data center with restricted access and appropriate monitoring, and we use a variety of technical security measures to secure your data. In addition, we use intrusion detection and virus protection software. <strong>However, please note that we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures.</strong></p>
    <br />
    <p>Also, please note that we may store and process your personal information in systems located outside of your home country. However, regardless of where storage and processing may occur, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your information is protected, consistent with the principles set forth under this statement.</p>
    <br />
    <p><a href='PrivacyPolicy.aspx.html#top'>Back to Top</a></p>
    <br />
    
    <h3>WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
    <p>We will not sell, rent, or lease mailing lists or other customer data to others, and we will not make your personal information available to any unaffiliated parties, except as follows:</p>
    <br />
    <ul class="standardBullets">
		<li>To agents and/or contractors who may use it on our behalf or in connection with their relationship with us (for example, we may use third parties to help us with promotional campaigns).</li>
		<li>As required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, as needed in connection with the transfer of our business assets (for example, if we are acquired by another company or if we are liquidated during bankruptcy proceedings), or if we believe in good faith that sharing the data is necessary to protect our rights or property.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>We also rely on some of our affiliates for support of the products and services we offer, and we share some of our back-office functions with other Thomson Reuters companies. Our affiliates are all required to preserve the confidentiality of any personal information they may access.</p>
    <br />
    <p>We will not disclose any information about your usage to unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary to service the account, to enforce the terms of use, to meet our obligations to content and technology providers, or as required by law. For example, if you view our Continuing Legal Education (CLE) content, West LegalEdcenter is obligated to pass along your name, attorney identification number, and contact information to third-party content providers and some state accreditation agencies. They may contact you as a result.</p>
    <br />
    <p>We may also use statistics regarding usage for product development purposes, but we only use those statistics in the aggregate and they don't include any personally identifiable information about individual users.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Your access to some of our services and content may be password protected, such as via OnePass. We recommend that you refrain from disclosing your username(s) and password(s) to anyone. We also recommend that you sign out of your account or service at the end of each session. You may also wish to close your browser window when you have finished your work, especially if you share a computer with someone else or if you are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.</p>
