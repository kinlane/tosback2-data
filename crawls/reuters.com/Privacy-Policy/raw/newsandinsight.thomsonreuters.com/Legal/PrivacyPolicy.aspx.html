Our analytics provider has access to this unique identifier.  Additionally, we store your username as well as information regarding purchased content and use of the application in other local files on your computer.  This information is stored in order to help the application work. The “flash cookies” and other files used by the News & Insight application can be deleted by uninstalling and deleting the application, but cannot be removed by deleting browser cookies, web cache, website data, temporary Internet files, or by using other browser controls or add-ons.</p>
    <p>News & Insight mobile application.  If you use News & Insight on a mobile device, we will also store information locally on the device regarding the content that you purchase, access, and view, as well as your username.  This information is stored in order to help the application work.  This information is deleted from your device when you delete the application.   However, unique identifiers that are persistently associated with your device, including UDID, MAC address, or unique identifiers derived from your device’s technical information, will remain the same after deletion of the News & Insight application,</p>

If and when these third party services collect information, they do so without collecting Personal Information.</p>

    <h3>HOW DOES THOMSON REUTERS PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IT COLLECTS?</h3>
    <p>We have implemented certain appropriate security measures to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

Also, we store Personal Information in a data center with restricted access and appropriate monitoring, and we use a variety of technical security measures to secure your data. In addition, we use intrusion detection and virus protection software. <strong>However, please note that we do not guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures.</strong></p>
    <br />
    <p>Also, please note that we may store and process your personal information in systems located outside of your home country, including countries located outside of the European Union. However, regardless of where storage and processing may occur, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your information is protected, consistent with the principles set forth under this statement.</p>
