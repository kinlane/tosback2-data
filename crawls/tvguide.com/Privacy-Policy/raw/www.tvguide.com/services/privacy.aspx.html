    <div class="deck">Last Revised July 25, 2011<br /><br />
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE RELATED TERMS OF SERVICE LOCATED AT <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/services/terms.aspx">http://www.tvguide.com/services/terms.aspx</a> CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE.<br /><br />
This website is operated by TV Guide Online Holdings, LLC on its own behalf or in combination with one of its film or television divisions or joint ventures (collectively referred to herein, solely for ease of reference, as "Company", "us" or "we").  This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to all of the online and mobile websites and interactive applications operated by Company (unless a different policy is provided on a particular site or application, in which case such different policy shall control).  Protection of personal and sensitive information is paramount. This Privacy Policy discloses what type of information is collected, the methods used to collect it, how Company utilizes the information to better serve all interested parties and the choices you have about the way your information is collected and used. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.  Your use of any Company website indicates that you have read, accepted and unconditionally agreed to the Company privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy and any other applicable terms. The Terms of Service <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/services/terms.aspx">http://www.tvguide.com/services/terms.aspx</a> for this website are incorporated herein by this reference.
</div>
  
    <div class="title">Children</div>
    <div class="deck">We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children’s use of online activities regularly. This website supports and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and other applicable laws. This website is not aimed at nor intended for children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use this website, and if you are over the age of 13 but under the age of 18, you should use this website only with the involvement and permission of a parent or legal guardian. Our website does not accept registration from children under the age of 13. No personally identifiable information is purposefully or knowingly collected from children under the age of 13 by Company without parental consent.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, personally identifiable information ("PII") is personal information about an individual, such as a first and last name, phone number or email address or other individually identifiable information within the meaning of COPPA and the Federal Trade Commission’s Online Privacy Protection Rule found at 16 CFR 312.2.   If Company discovers that a person under the age of 13 has provided Company with any PII, Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such person’s PII from its system. Every user hereby agrees that all information you provide, including but not limited to age, shall be truthful and correct. </div>
    
    <div class="title">Information We Collect</div>
    <div class="deck">Company strives to provide our visitors with information relevant to their particular desires, needs and/or interests. The information we gather helps us to better serve our purpose.  We may ask you to provide us with demographic information, information regarding your interests or other PII.  Providing us with PII about yourself is voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the website’s features. Company actively and passively gathers, analyzes and/or stores PII and other information generally by way of four different sources: (1) the PII voluntarily submitted by visitors when using or registering to use or receive our services or offers; (2) the PII visitors voluntarily provide when participating in any contests, sweepstakes and/or other promotions; (3) the PII visitors voluntarily provide when buying or ordering merchandise through the website; and (4) by tracking and analyzing online and mobile data and activity through mechanisms that identify site usage, browser types, IP addresses, and other data.  This last source of information is explained in greater detail over the next several sections of this Privacy Policy. </div>
    
      <div class="title">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</div>
    <div class="deck">When your computer or mobile device contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit this website, scan a Microsoft Tag or QR code, or view an HTML e-mail), our web servers automatically collect usage information.  Such usage information includes information about how our visitors use and navigate our website. It can include the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our website, and IP addresses (see below for more information on IP addresses). We also may determine the applicable technology available in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page, e-mail, advertising or promotional announcement or similar service. This information is used to analyze and improve this website and to provide you with a more fulfilling and relevant experience.</div>
    
    
    <div class="title">Browser Cookies</div>
    <div class="deck">Like many websites, we use browser "cookies".  Cookies are a website’s way of remembering who you are.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer’s hard drive or stored temporarily in your computer’s memory. There are two kinds of cookies: those that are "session" oriented and those that are "persistent". Session cookies delete from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies retain information for later use tomorrow, next week, next month, or whenever they are set to expire.  We use cookies to help us to identify account holders and to optimize their experience on our website.  Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves this website without checking out.  Also, we will use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of this website.  Most web browsers accept cookies automatically.  You can delete cookies manually or set your browser to automatically delete cookies on a pre-determined schedule.  For example, in the Internet Explorer menu bar, select: Tools-->Internet Options-->Browsing History-->Delete to view manual and automatic options.  If you decline to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of this website.</div>
    
    
    <div class="title">Flash Cookies</div>
    <div class="deck">Our website enables the use of the Adobe Flash Player.  Adobe’s Flash Player is used by the vast majority of websites that offer video and other interactive content.  By default, your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates "flash cookies" (also known as "persistent identification elements" or "local shared objects").  Adobe provides a short disclosure about Flash Cookies in its End User License Agreement, stating "Use of the web players, specifically the Flash Player, will enable the Software to store certain user settings as a local shared object on our computer.  These settings are not associated with you, but allow you to configure certain settings within the Flash Player."  The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) uses flash cookies to remember user settings, preferences and usage similar to the browser cookies referenced above, but flash cookies can store more information than browser cookies and are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser.  You can control the degree to which you accept flash cookies from any website by accessing your Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the settings manager for Adobe Flash Player, located at: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>.  <br /><br />
If you do not allow flash cookies to take any disc space on your computer, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features on the website.  Users with a computer running the Windows operating system can view flash cookie files in this folder: \Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player.  Users with a computer running the Apple operating system can view flash cookie files in this folder: /users/[username]/Library/Preferences/macromedia/Flash Player.  Flash cookies, or LSO files are stored typically with an ".SOL" extension. Although the Adobe Flash Player is used by the vast majority of websites that offer video content and/or games, it is not the only technology being used in the ever-shifting online and mobile content environment.  HTML5 is an increasingly popular web standard used for presenting content, especially content delivered to mobile devices.  HTML is the mark-up language used for the World Wide Web. Almost all web pages you visit on the internet are based around HTML code. HTML5 is simply the fifth and latest iteration of this mark-up language that allows for more interactive web pages.  One of the real benefits of HTML5 is its potential to standardize the highly fragmented rich-media universe.  Some HTML5 code may allow your response to advertising and other activities to be monitored across websites and such information to be stored on your computer or mobile device.  Technology solutions that allow users to opt-out of or block this sort of tracking are being developed through browser add-ons and other tools. 

</div>
    
    <div class="title">Web Beacons</div>
    <div class="deck">Our web pages or e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon, which is sometimes also called a "clear gif", that allows us to monitor and collect certain limited information about our users, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small or invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate our website, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many of the messages we sent were actually opened or acted upon. We use web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about our website and our marketing campaigns. </div>
    
    <div class="title">Use Of IP Addresses</div>
    <div class="deck">An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when you are linked to the Internet. When you request pages from this website, our servers log your IP address. We may use IP address for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the use of the website.  We may associate your IP address with the PII you provide.<br /><br />
We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.

</div>
    
    <div class="title">Sensitive Information</div>
    <div class="deck">There are two ways sensitive information (e.g. credit card numbers) may be obtained. When a visitor makes a purchase, his/her information may be sent directly to a third party authorization center that will relay to Company whether to proceed with the transaction. The information is not at all stored in our system. The second way is when a visitor pre-orders merchandise. In this case, the information is sent to a non-public server and stored until the transaction is complete. <br /><br />
Company uses all possible efforts to ensure the safety of your sensitive information. No website, internet transmission, computer system or wireless connection is completely secure. Company cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. Your use of the Company website is at your own risk. Company urges you to take steps to keep your information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your account information), logging out of your account, and closing your web browser.  In order to help us protect your sensitive information and PII further, you should be careful about providing your password to others.<br /><br />
Whenever you give Company sensitive or confidential information, Company will take commercially reasonable steps to protect the information by establishing a secure connection with your web browser. Company uses the Security Socket Layer ("SSL"), an industry standard security protocol for encrypting sensitive information.   Unfortunately, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed 100% secure.  We cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Company and you do so at your own risk.

<u><em>Aggregate Information</em></u>: We may disclose non-identifying, aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes, including describing our services to prospective partners and other third parties. Examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited this website during a specific time period or purchased a specific product through this website. <br /><br />

    <div class="title">Third Party Advertisements</div>
    <div class="deck">We may from time to time use various outside ad-serving or other companies to serve advertisements on our website. In the process of serving advertisements, such companies may use cookies, and may use information about your visits to our website and other websites in order to provide advertisements on our website about products and services that may be of interest to you.

<div class="title">How Can I Access, Correct and Update Personal Information? </div>
    <div class="deck">You can access, correct and update certain personal information that you have provided to us by visiting our profile management page here: <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/AMP/UpdateProfile.aspx">http://www.tvguide.com/AMP/UpdateProfile.aspx</a>. Please be aware that we will process your request as quickly as we reasonably can, but it may not be possible to update our systems immediately.

</div>
<div class="title">Your choices/unsubscribe</div>
    <div class="deck"> You will have an opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving promotional material from this website by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in promotional emails we send you. Additionally you may update your preferences here: <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/AMP/UpdateProfile.aspx">http://www.tvguide.com/AMP/UpdateProfile.aspx</a>. Because customer lists often are prepared well in advance of an offering (sometimes a few months before the offer is made), you may continue to receive some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified marketing purposes. Please be aware that we will process your request as quickly as we reasonably can, but it may not be possible to update our systems immediately. We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to carry out your request.<br /><br />
    
Even if you are removed from any such list, if you order online, we will send you an email confirming your order and may need to contact you by phone, email, or regular mail if we have questions about your order. In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.<br /><br />

If you want to opt out of having your PII shared with third parties for marketing purposes, you must consistently opt-out at each of our websites where you register and whenever you provide PII to us.  Please bear in mind that this opt-out choice for "third parties" will not apply to Company, Company licensees and/or co-branding participants, as set forth below.  Please also keep in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where (a) you either have made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for information from us, or (b) Company uses your PII for either operational purposes (e.g., to complete transactions requested by you, or to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our websites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy, or any other policy or terms that affect you and your use of our website) or fulfillment purposes (e.g., sharing with companies that facilitate communications and transactions with you).<br /><br />

Finally, if you do not exercise your opt-out choices upon registration or otherwise at the time the PII is provided, it may take some time to process your opt-out choices. Our systems require time to update, and promotional mailings using PII shared before your opt-out may already be in process. Thus, your PII might continue to be shared with third parties for promotional purposes for some time after you make your request,  For similar reasons, if your PII is shared with a third party, Company largely or completely loses control over how that information is used.  Thus, even after you have opted out of allowing us to share your PII, you might continue to receive promotional materials from third parties unless and until you duly register your opt-out request with each third party in question.
