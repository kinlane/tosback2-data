            <p>You can visit our Web Sites without sharing personally identifiable information. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>You can visit our Web Sites without telling us who you are and without revealing any personally identifiable information to learn about American Honda Motor Co., Inc. ("AHM"), American Honda Finance Corporation ("AHFC"), our product and service information, special offers and promotions, and investor information. &nbsp;You can also access financial planning tools. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>"Personally identifiable information or personal information" refers to any information that identifies or can be used to contact or locate you such as name, mailing address, phone number, email address, social security number, and account number. &nbsp;Use of certain features and tools on this Site requires that you provide us with personally identifiable information. &nbsp;However, you always have the option not to provide personal information by choosing not to use a particular feature. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>We may request personally identifiable information in order to enhance your experience on our web sites. &nbsp;There are instances where American Honda requests personally identifiable information to provide the web site visitor a service or correspondence (such as promotions and mailed brochures). This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, type of request and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data and is used to fulfill your request. The information you provide is used by American Honda to improve the services we provide you and to help us promote products and services that are of most interest to you. &nbsp;The information may be merged with other information American Honda already knows, such as whether you are an owner of a Honda or Acura vehicle.</p>
            <p>To use American Honda's Internet services, such as the Dealer Locator and brochure requests, we require a certain amount of personally identifying information such as name and address to meet your request. &nbsp;We may use this information to identify and access data in the existing relationship we have with you to provide you with the requested services. &nbsp;We may request email addresses as an alternate means of contacting you.</p>
            <p>
                <span style=" color: #ff0000;">We collect and use anonymous information</span>
            </p>
            <p>We may gather and store certain anonymous information about your visit, including the name of your Internet Service Provider (ISP), the type of browser and operating systems used to access our site, the date and time you access our site, the website that referred you to us, and the pages you visit (click-through). &nbsp;This information does not identify you personally. &nbsp;This information is collected and used to generate statistics, measure site activity, and improve the usefulness of our sites.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Some of our sites, such as Automobiles.Honda.com and Owner Link/My Acura, use web beacons also called single pixel gifs.

It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy. In short, web beacons collect only a limited amount of information including cookies and time and date of viewing and do not contain personally identifiable information.
