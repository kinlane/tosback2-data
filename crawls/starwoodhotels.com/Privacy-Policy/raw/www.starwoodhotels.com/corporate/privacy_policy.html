    <h2 class="subhead">PURPOSE FOR COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND DISCLOSURE:</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Collection &amp; Use</b>
    </p>
    <p>Starwood is fully committed to providing you with information about the
collection and use of PII furnished by, or collected from, visitors while using
our web sites, products and services. It is our practice not to ask you for
information unless we need it or intend to use it. Some of the primary purposes
for collecting your PII are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>providing services such as processing a transaction (e.g., making a
reservation, fulfilling a request for information, or completing a product
order)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>marketing and communications with you in relation to the products and
services offered by Starwood, our strategic marketing partners, and other
trusted third parties</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>performing market research via surveys to better serve your needs, improve
the effectiveness of our web sites, your hotel experience, our various types of
communications, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may opt out of marketing emails and Starwood surveys at any time by
clicking on the link included in such communications, or by contacting us
directly to opt out of direct marketing, telemarketing, emails or surveys.
Please <a href="privacy_policy.html#contact">click here</a> to see the Updating Your Communication
Preferences in the Contact Us section of this privacy statement. You will
always be offered the choice not to submit your PII or to decide what
communications you want to receive from us. However, doing so may cause certain
transactions to become affected. For example, not providing a name will prevent
the processing of reservations.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Processing and Disclosure</b>
    </p>
    <p>In most cases, the information you provide is added to a local or global
database. In the course of processing your information, it may be necessary to
transfer your PII to Starwood's affiliates, properties within the Starwood
system and/or third party service providers located in the United States and
throughout the world for the purposes outlined within this Privacy Statement.
Unless otherwise precluded or governed by legal requirements and/or process,
Starwood subsidiaries, affiliates and property owners that may receive your
information are required to abide by substantially similar privacy requirements
relating to your PII. As a general practice, Starwood does not sell, rent, or
give physical possession of your PII to unaffiliated third parties outside the
Starwood system. Situations in which Starwood may disclose your information to
others include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>when we have received your consent to do so</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>in situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in
order to offer you products or services you desire (e.g., a vacation
package)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>when companies or services providers that perform business activities on
behalf of Starwood require such information (e.g., credit card processing,
customer support services, market research administration or database
management services)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>when a hotel or other property leaves the Starwood system and access to your
PII is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual
obligations</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>in the event Starwood is merged or acquired by another company</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance
with applicable law, a court order or a subpoena</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>in case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of
an individual</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of
information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of
the specific function. Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require
third parties to protect your PII and abide by applicable privacy laws and
regulations.</p>

    <a name="CONSENT"></a>
    <h2 class="subhead">CONSENT:</h2>
    <p>As part of our commitment to keep you informed, we may mail, e-mail,
telephone, or contact you by other means to notify you of new Starwood products
and services, or upcoming Starwood special offers, events, enhancements, or
other relevant information that may be of interest to you. You may also receive
mailings or other communications from carefully selected third parties. We
offer you the option to decline any or all of these Starwood communications by
following the directions included in our e-mails or other communications, or by
contacting Starwood directly.</p>
    <p>If you are a Starwood Preferred Guest (&ldquo;SPG&rdquo;) program member, you may also
change your communication choices by updating your communication preferences in
your individual membership profile.</p>
    <p>We would like to keep all of our guests and visitors informed and equally
able to take advantage of the benefits offered by Starwood and its strategic
marketing partners. However, if you reside outside of the United States,
certain data privacy regulations may require us to obtain your permission
before we send you information that you have not requested from us.</p>
    <p>In some cases your permission will be implied from the nature of the service
requested or transaction undertaken. For example, Starwood may collect and use
PII that you volunteer, or behavioral data or information collected in the
aggregate. In addition, your permission will be deemed given for communications

request.</p>
    <p>In certain circumstances, we will seek your express permission when we
collect information that is regarded under certain data privacy regulations to
be sensitive in nature (e.g., information revealing racial or ethnic origin,
political opinions, or health conditions).</p>
    <p>You may object to Starwood disclosing your PII with third parties except
when: (i) service providers have been retained to perform services on behalf of
Starwood; (ii) disclosure is required by law; (iii) disclosure concerns
national, legal or public interest grounds; (iv) disclosure is necessary to
protect the vital interests of the guest; (v) information has been collected
from publicly accessible sources; (vi) disclosure concerns the retrospective
processing of the information for historical, statistical or enhancement of
guest experiences; or (vii) disclosure is authorized by a supervisory authority
(such as a Privacy Commissioner, Data Protection Authority, or other similar
authority).</p>

    <h2 class="subhead">DATA TRANSFERS ACROSS INTERNATIONAL BORDERS:</h2>
    <p>As a global company, we endeavor to provide you with the same outstanding
service in New York City, as you would find in Paris or Beijing. To achieve
this goal, we have established a global network comprised of properties,
offices, data centers, trusted marketing partners, service providers, customer
contact centers, and trained associates around the globe. The nature of our
business and our operations require us to transfer your information, including
PII, to other group companies, properties, centers of operations, data centers,
or service providers that may be located in countries outside of your own. We
may transfer the PII we collect about you to countries other than the country
in which the information was originally collected. Although the data protection
and other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those
in your own country, Starwood will take appropriate steps to ensure that your
PII is protected and handled as described in this Privacy Statement. Japan

    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, we comply
with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the
transfer of PII to countries outside of the European Economic Area or
Switzerland. Starwood is certified under the Safe Harbor privacy frameworks as
set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, European Commission and
Switzerland regarding the collection, storage, use, transfer and other
processing of PII transferred from the European Economic Area or Switzerland to
the U.S. <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/promotions/promo_landing.html?category=SHPRST">

    <h2 class="subhead">ACCESS TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION:</h2>
    <p>To ensure that your PII is accurate and up to date, we encourage you to
regularly review and update your information as appropriate (e.g., in the event
your home or e-mail address changes, or you wish to add an additional method
for us to communicate with you). If you are an SPG program member, you can
review and update your individual membership profile on-line or with the
assistance of a Starwood customer service representative. If you are not a SPG
program member you can review and update your PII by contacting our Consumer
Affairs Privacy Office and requesting an access form. Please note that in an
effort to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of your PII, you may be asked to
provide proof of identity (or other authentication materials) together with the
completed access request form. Access to PII for non-SPG program members cannot
be provided by telephone.</p>
    <p>If, upon review, you wish to deactivate your SPG program member profile, or
update your PII, we will endeavor to do so in a timely manner. Occasionally,
information that you request to be removed will be retained in certain files
for a period of time in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot
problems. In addition, some types of information may be stored indefinitely on
"back up" systems or within log files due to technical constraints, or
financial or legal requirements. Therefore, you should not always expect that
all of your PII will be completely removed from our databases in response to
your request.</p>
    <p>Please refer to the appropriate contact information below to contact us
about updating your communication preferences, removal from our marketing
lists, or to submit a general question or request.</p>

    <h2 class="subhead">SECURITY SAFEGUARDS:</h2>
    <p>Starwood recognizes the importance of information security, and is
constantly reviewing and enhancing our technical, physical, and logical
security rules and procedures. All Starwood owned web sites and servers have
security measures in place to help protect your PII against accidental, loss,
misuse, unlawful or unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration while under
our control. Although "guaranteed security" does not exist either on or
off the Internet, we safeguard your information using appropriate
administrative, procedural and technical safeguards, including password
controls, "firewalls" and the use of up to 256-bit encryption based on
a Class 3 Digital Certificate issued by VeriSign, Inc. This allows for the use
of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption method used to help protect your
data from interception and hacking while in transit.</p>

    <p>Starwood and its third party marketing partners may use cookies, invisible
pixels, and web beacons to obtain information about you while visiting our web
sites. A cookie is a very small text file that is sent to your browser from a
web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Starwood cookies assign
your computer with a unique identifier, which in turn, becomes your
identification card whenever you return to a Starwood web site.</p>
    <p>Cookies are designed to save you time because they help us to provide you
with a customized experience without you having to remind us of your
preferences each time you return to our web pages. Starwood cookies are not
designed to damage your files, nor can they read information from other files
on your computer hard drive.</p>
    <p>Cookies can also help us provide you with a personalized on-line experience
in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>they remember your user name and password for future visits so log-in is
easier and faster.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>they ensure you are provided with the appropriate frames and content.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>they ensure you obtain all requested information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>they help us deliver communications that are relevant and responsive to your
interests and location.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Starwood cookies are limited to our web sites only, and are not designed to
follow you when traveling on the Internet after leaving Starwood owned web
sites. We track the usage of our web sites in order to better meet your needs
and to help make it easier for you to find information in the future. Please
note that in addition to Starwood cookies, various third parties may also place
cookies on your computer's hard drive. Starwood is not responsible for the
presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological
capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third
party cookies.</p>
    <p>If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your Internet
browser can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the
type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so
that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis
or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at
all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for
specific details about cookie security. However, you should also understand
that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain
transactions on our web sites and our ability to recognize your browser from
one visit to the next.</p>
    <p>Starwood also uses invisible pixels, sometimes called web beacons, to count
how many people visit certain web pages. Information collected from invisible
pixels is used and reported in the aggregate and does not contain PII. Starwood
may use this information to improve marketing programs and content.</p>
    <p>We also work with vendors and marketing partners to help deliver
advertisements and personalized content that we believe will be of interest to
you. These vendors and other partners include advertisers, advertising
agencies, advertising networks, audience segment providers, data exchanges,
analytics providers, and other similar providers. Please <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/promotions/promo_landing.html?category=VNAGLS">
click here</a> for a current list of the agencies and providers with which we
work. These partners and vendors use cookies and web beacons to collect
information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have
visited at Starwood sites and other third party sites) in order to help
Starwood (and in some cases, third party advertisers) deliver personalized
content and advertising to you while you are on Starwood or other sites.</p>
    <p>For example, if you go to a Starwood site to look at one of our properties
or to book a hotel room, you may later see an advertisement from us when you
visit another web site. We may also engage one of these vendors to deliver our
advertisements to consumers whose online behaviors on sites other than the
Starwood sites indicate that they may be interested in travel. In other
instances, we engage in special arrangements with certain advertisers with
which we think our web site visitors would have an interest. We allow these
advertisers to deliver co-branded messages (e.g., Starwood and the advertiser)
directly to consumers who have visited our web pages. These types of cobranded
advertisements may appear on Starwood sites or on third party sites. In
general, you can opt out of our vendors' use of cookies to tailor personalized
content or advertising to you by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>
and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>
    <p>We also work with vendors to deliver our advertisements directly to those
who are traveling or about to travel. For example, when you print your boarding
pass online, one of our vendors may drop a cookie on your computer, identifying
your computer with a unique identifier and a code indicating your destination.
We use this vendor to deliver advertisements to you indicating our available
properties in the destination indicated on your boarding pass. To opt-out of
these types of advertisements from us, <a href="http://www.sojern.com/privacy-policy">click here</a> and follow the
directions in the Sojern Privacy Policy for opting out.</p>

    <p>In order to anticipate your needs, Starwood provides links to other web
sites for your convenience and information. Starwood is not responsible or
liable for any content presented by or contained on any independent web site,
including, but not limited to, any advertising claims or marketing practices.
Please note that while Starwood will protect your information on Starwood owned

privacy policies of third party web sites, including web sites owned or
controlled by independent franchisees, third party owners of hotel, resort,
interval ownership, or residence properties that may use the name of a Starwood
brand, or web sites not controlled or authorized by Starwood. Third party web
sites that are accessed through links on our web sites have separate privacy
and data collection practices, and security measures. We have no responsibility
or liability for the practices, policies and security measures implemented by
third parties on their web sites. We encourage you to contact them to ask
questions about their privacy practices, policies and security measures before
disclosing any PII. We recommend that you review the privacy statements and
policies of linked web sites to understand how those web sites collect, use and
store information.</p>
