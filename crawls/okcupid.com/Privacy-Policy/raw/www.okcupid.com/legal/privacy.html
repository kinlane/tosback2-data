When you provide personal information through our website, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world. </p> <p> <strong>Information you provide.</strong> We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information such as your hometown or your username. </p> <p> <strong>Information from other sources.</strong> OkCupid is a part of the IAC family of businesses (please see <a href="http://www.iac.com/">www.iac.com</a>), which as of the date of this policy includes Match.com, Ask.com, Citysearch, ServiceMagic, Pronto, Shoebuy, College Humor, and many others companies and websites.

If you use our website to send others (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) a product as a gift, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of each such recipient in order to process those requests or facilitate future activities. </p> <p> <strong>Use of cookies and other technologies to collect information.</strong> We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our site. </p> <p> <strong>Information collected automatically.</strong> We automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our website.

We also may include web beacons in advertisements or email messages to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer our website visitors to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities. </p> <p> <strong>Information collected by third-parties.</strong> We may allow third-parties, including our authorized service providers, IAC companies, advertising companies and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as <strong>cookies</strong>, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>). </p> <p class="totop"><a href="privacy.html#top">back to top</a></p> <h2>How we use the information we collect</h2> <p> <strong>In General.</strong> We may use information that we collect about you to: <ul> <li>deliver the products and services that you have requested.</li> <li>manage your account and provide you with customer support.</li> <li>perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content, or products, services or content offered by others.</li> <li>communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us, other IAC companies or other third parties.</li> <li>develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our site and other sites.</li> <li>verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes.</li> <li>enforce or exercise any rights in our terms and conditions.</li> <li>manage our business.</li> <li>provide our advertisements to you when you visit other sites.</li> <li>perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</li> </ul> </p> <p> <strong>Financial information.</strong> We may use financial information or payment method information to process payment for any purchases made on our website, enroll you in the discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business. </p> <p> <strong>Job applicants.</strong> If your personal information is submitted through our website when applying for a position with our company, the information will be used solely in connection with considering and acting upon your application. We may retain your personal information for a period of time, but only for the purpose of considering your application for current or future available positions. This information, which may include your name and contact information, prior education and experience, and other information you provided to us, may be shared with other IAC companies for the purpose of evaluating your qualifications for the particular position or other available positions, as well as with third-party service providers retained by us to collect, maintain and analyze candidate submissions for job postings. </p> <p>Please review Your choices about collection and use of your information below.</p> <p class="totop"><a href="privacy.html#top">back to top</a></p> <h2>With whom we share your information</h2> <p> <strong>Personal information.</strong> We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with: </p> <p> <strong>Service providers:</strong> We may share your personal information, which may include your name and contact information (including email address), with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, member screenings, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our website. We may also share your name, contact information and credit card information with our authorized service providers who process credit card payments. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. </p> <p> <strong>Business partners:</strong> When you make purchases on our website or click-through our advertisements offered on third party websites, we may share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you the applicable products, services or advertisements. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other information to that merchant. </p> <p> <strong>Other Situations.</strong> We also may disclose your information, including personal information: </p> <p> In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. </p> <p> When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies. </p> <p> In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. </p> <p> <strong>Aggregated and non-personal information.</strong> We may share non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with IAC companies and third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our website and on websites of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.   </p> <p class="totop"><a href="privacy.html#top">back to top</a></p> <h2>Third-party websites</h2> <p> There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting. </p> <p class="totop"><a href="privacy.html#top">back to top</a></p> <h2>How you can access your information</h2> <p> If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account and clicking on Settings. More information about how to contact us is provided below. If you have an online account with us, you also may delete or disable your account at any time by visiting the "Settings" page for your account. If you delete or disable your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies. </p> <p class="totop"><a href="privacy.html#top">back to top</a></p> <h2>Your choices about collection and use of your information</h2> <p> You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website. </p> <p> At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by submitting this request to privacy@okcupid.com. You may be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. We request a reasonable time to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications, will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a service provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party. </p> <p> You can also control information collected by cookies. See <strong>Cookies</strong> below for information about declining or deleting cookies. </p> <p class="totop"><a href="privacy.html#top">back to top</a></p> <h2>How we protect your personal information</h2> <p> We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">Federal Trade Commission's website</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft. </p> <p class="totop"><a href="privacy.html#top">back to top</a></p> <h2>Information you provide about yourself while using our service</h2> <p> We provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/terms">Terms &amp; Conditions.</a> In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. </p> <p class="totop"><a href="privacy.html#top">back to top</a></p> <h2>Children's privacy</h2> <p> Although our website is a general audience site, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. </p> <p class="totop"><a href="privacy.html#top">back to top</a></p> <h2>Visiting our websites from outside the United States </h2> <p> This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our website from residents of the United States. If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated.

They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness.
