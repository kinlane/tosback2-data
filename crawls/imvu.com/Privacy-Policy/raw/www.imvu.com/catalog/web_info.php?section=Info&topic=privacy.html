<h2 id="co-branded">Co-branded sites</h2>
<p>Some pages may have the look and feel of being on the Site (i.e. www.imvu.com), however the information collected on these pages may not be covered under our Privacy Policy.  For example, all information collected on www.jobscore.com is owned and controlled by that company's Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>The Site allows users to access Facebook Connect to interact with friends and to share on Facebook through Wall and friends' News Feeds.

<h2 id="eu-notice">Notice to European Users</h2>
<p>The information you enter on this Site or otherwise provide to IMVU may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union. In particular, you are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union’s Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by IMVU on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 id="update-pii">Correction/Updating PII</h2>
<p>IMVU provides you with the ability to review, correct and delete the PII that you have provided to us in your account. If you wish to review or correct any information you have provided to us, you may access your account and review, correct, and/or delete your PII by logging into your account and selecting "Account Settings".</p>

<h2 id="children">IMVU and Children</h2>
<p>IMVU recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. IMVU does not target its services or this Site to children under 13.
