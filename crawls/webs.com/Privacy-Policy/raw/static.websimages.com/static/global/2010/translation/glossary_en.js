		<div id="levels">\
			<h1>Administrators:</h1>\
			<p>Can access all main editing features for your site including creating, editing and deleting pages, posting content, and managing members.  Admins CANNOT modify the privileges of the site owner or other admins, and they cannot modify the site email or password. </p>\
			<h1>Moderators:</h1>\
			<p>Can delete comments and posts by members and visitors. </p>\
			<h1>Members:</h1>\
			<p>Typically are allowed to comment and post comment.  You can restrict or enable their ability to post content (like new photos) through the .Settings. buttons on your apps.</p>\
			<h1>Limited Members:</h1>\
			<p>Typically can only comment on things.</p>\
		</div>\
		<p>You can choose what each group can do on a per page and per app basis.  For example, you can choose to restrict posting to your Blog to only Administrators or Moderators.  Each of your apps (like the photo gallery, blog, video gallery, etc.) has a .Settings. page where you can enable and disable features for your members.</p>\
		\
		<h1>Note:</h1>\
		<p>Each level is inclusive of the rights in the levels beneath it (i.e. Administrators have all the rights of Moderators, and Moderators have all the rights of Members, etc.)  In addition, sometimes, you may come across an option to set something as .Members Only..  .Members Only. is a generic reference to all signed in members of your site, regardless of what permission level they have.</p>',
